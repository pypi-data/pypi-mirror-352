  Normative modeling of EEG/MEG brain dynamics across populations and timescales.
</p>


**MEGaNorm** is a Python package that wraps [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) and [PCNToolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit) functionalities for extracting functional imaging-derived phenotypes (f-IDPs) from large-scale EEG and MEG datasets, and then deriving their normative ranges. It allows researchers to analyze large MEG and EEG dataset using high-performance computing facilities, and then build, visualize, and analyze normative models of brain dynamics across individuals.

## üöÄ Features

* Compatibility with MNE-Python, PCNToolkit, SpecParam libraries
* Normative modeling of oscillatory brain activity
* Using high performance capabilities on SLURM clusters 
* EEG and MEG support with BIDS integration
* Ready for reproducible deployment with Docker

---

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: From PyPI (recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started if you just want to use the toolbox.

```bash
conda create --channel=conda-forge --strict-channel-priority --name mne python=3.12 mne

conda activate mne

pip install meganorm
```

---

### Option 2: Installl from the source files

```bash
# 1. Create and activate environment
conda create --channel=conda-forge --strict-channel-priority --name mne python=3.12 mne

conda activate mne

# 2. Clone and install MEGaNorm
git clone https://github.com/ML4PNP/MEGaNorm.git
cd MEGaNorm/
pip install .
```

---

### Option 3: Using Docker

We provide a pre-configured Docker environment with Jupyter Lab. You can either **build the image locally** or **pull the latest version from Docker Hub**.

#### Option A: Build the image locally

```bash
make build
make run
```

#### Option B: Pull the latest image from Docker Hub

```bash
make pull
make run
```

This mounts:

* `notebooks/` ‚Üí for saving Jupyter notebooks
* `results/` ‚Üí for analysis outputs
* `data/` ‚Üí for raw/processed EEG/MEG data

Jupyter will open in your browser on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

## üìí Getting Started (under construction)

üëâ **documentation** Early helpers are available at: [https://meganorm.readthedocs.io](https://meganorm.readthedocs.io). We are working hard to add more thorough documentations and tutorials and they will be available soon.

```python 
import meganorm
```

Explore examples in the [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) folder.
