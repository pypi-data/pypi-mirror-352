**SearchFlox, powered by ArcDevs, is an AI-Powered Research Platform and advanced CLI tool leveraging ArcDevs Intelligence for intelligent research and automated report generation.**

It utilizes AI agents to connect to services and perform comprehensive searches, analyze information, and compile reports based on user queries.
*(For educational purposes, this project explores concepts similar to those that might be used by services like `searc.ai`.)*

## 🚀 Features

*   **🧠 AI-Powered Research:** Employs advanced AI for in-depth information gathering.
*   **📄 Multiple Report Types:** Generate summaries, detailed reports, or multi-agent analyses.
*   **🎨 Customizable Tone:** Adjust the writing tone of reports (Objective, Formal, Analytical, etc.).
*   **🌐 Domain Filtering:** Focus research on specific websites or domains.
*   **💬 Interactive Mode:** Conduct multiple research queries in a single session.
*   **⚙️ Configurable:** Save default preferences for report types and tones.
*   **💾 Multiple Output Formats:** Save reports as text, Markdown, or JSON.
*   **📡 Real-time Logging:** (Optional) View the AI's research process live.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install SearchFlox using pip:

```bash
pip install searchflox
```

*(This command will work once the package version with these updates is published to PyPI. For local development, see the section below.)*

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Search

Execute a search query directly from your terminal:

```bash
searchflox "your research query here"
```

**Example:**

```bash
searchflox "latest advancements in quantum computing"
```

You can also use the short alias `sf`:
```bash
sf "latest advancements in quantum computing"
```

### Command-Line Options

Fine-tune your research with these options:

*   **Report Type (`-t` or `--type`):**
    *   `summary`: Quick overview (~2 min)
    *   `multi_agents_report`: Collaborative analysis
    *   `research_report`: Comprehensive research (~5 min)
    ```bash
    searchflox -t research_report "CRISPR gene editing ethics"
    ```

*   **Report Tone (`-o` or `--tone`):**
    *   `objective`: Impartial and unbiased
    *   `formal`: Academic and professional
    *   `analytical`: Critical evaluation
    *   `persuasive`: Convincing and argumentative
    *   `informative`: Clear and comprehensive
    ```bash
    sf -o formal "economic impact of renewable energy"
    ```

*   **Specific Domains (`-d` or `--domains`):**
    Provide a space-separated list of domains.
    ```bash
    searchflox -d arxiv.org nature.com "dark matter theories"
    ```

*   **No Real-time Logs (`--no-logs`):**
    Disables the streaming output of agent activities for a cleaner console.
    ```bash
    searchflox --no-logs "history of the internet"
    ```

*   **Output to File (`-O` or `--output` with `--format`):**
    Save your research findings directly to a file. Supported formats: `text`, `markdown`, `json`.
    ```bash
    searchflox "Python web frameworks" -O report.md --format markdown
    sf "Market analysis of AI startups" -O analysis.json --format json
    ```

### Interactive Mode

For an engaging session with multiple queries or to easily change settings on the fly:

```bash
searchflox --interactive
# or
sf --interactive
```

Inside interactive mode:
*   Type `help` for a list of available commands.
*   Current settings (type/tone) are shown in the prompt.
*   Use `set <option> <value>` to change settings for the current session (e.g., `set type summary`).

### Configuration

Customize your default SearchFlox experience:

```bash
searchflox --config
# or
sf --config
```

Set your preferred report type, tone, and other settings. These are typically saved to `~/.searchflox/config.json` (the directory name matches the package).
