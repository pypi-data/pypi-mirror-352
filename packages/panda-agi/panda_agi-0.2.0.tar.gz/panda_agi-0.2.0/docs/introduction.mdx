## What is PandaAGI?

PandaAGI is a powerful SDK that lets you build AI applications with **agentic capabilities**. We redefine AGI as **Agentic General Intelligence**: AI that accomplishes tasks through tools rather than mimicking human thought.

## How PandaAGI Works

PandaAGI is built on three core components that work together to provide a seamless development experience:

<Frame caption="PandaAGI Architecture">

</Frame>

1. **The API**: A bidirectional WebSocket connection enabling real-time, stateful interaction between your application and AI agents

2. **The SDK**: Handles all the complex orchestration, agent state management, and communication so you can focus on building your application

3. **The Execution Environment**: A secure, isolated context where agents can safely run code and interact with external systems

## Built-in Agent Capabilities

Every PandaAGI agent comes with powerful execution capabilities out of the box:

| Capability | Purpose | Benefits |
|:----------|:--------|:---------|
| üåê **Internet Access** | Information gathering | Always up-to-date data from any source |
| üóÇÔ∏è **File System** | Asset management | Create, modify and organize files seamlessly |
| üíª **Code Execution** | Dynamic programming | Run code in multiple languages with full security |
| üöÄ **Deployment** | Web servers & APIs | Deploy applications directly from your agent |
