# LbAPLocal

LbAPLocal is the python library for running offline tests for the LHCb AnalysisProductions framework.


## Usage

LbAPLocal is installed by default with the LHCb environment on lxplus.  For users on external clusters, one can source the LHCb environment from CVMFS to get setup: ``` source /cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/LbEnv ```
After installing, LbAPLocal can be run from the command line with the following options:

```
Usage: lb-ap [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line tool for the LHCb AnalysisProductions

Options:
  --version
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  versions   List the available tags of the Analysis Productions...
  checkout   Clean out the current copy of the specified production and...
  clone      Clone the AnalysisProductions repository and do lb-ap...
  list       List the available production folders by running 'lb-ap list'
  list-checks  List the checks for a specific production by running lb-ap...
  render     Render the info.yaml for a given production
  validate   Validate the configuration for a given production
  test       Execute a job locally
  check      Run checks for a production
  debug      Start an interactive session inside the job's environment
  reproduce  Reproduce an existing online test locally
  parse-log  Read a Gaudi log file and extract information
```

To update an existing production:
```bash
$ lb-ap checkout <version> <working_group> <production> <branch>
```
where `version` is the latest version of AnalysisProductions corresponding to `production`, `working_group` is the working group the production belongs to, `production` is the production you want to update and `branch` is the name of the branch you want to work on.

If you don't yet have a local copy of AnalysisProductions:
```bash
$ lb-ap clone <version> <working_group> <production> <branch> <clone_type>
```
where `version`, `working_group`, `production` and `branch` are defined as above. `clone_type` can be either `ssh`, `https` or `krb5`, by default it is `ssh`.

To see which versions of the repository are available for a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap versions B2OC B02DKPi
The available versions for B02DKPi are:
  v0r0p1674088
  v0r0p1735460
  .
  .
  .
```

To see which productions are available locally:
```bash
$ lb-ap list
The available productions are:
* MyAnalysis
```

To see which jobs are available for a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap list MyAnalysis
The available jobs for MyAnalysis are:
* My2016MagDownJob
* My2016MagUpJob
```

To see which checks are defined for a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap list-checks MyAnalysis
The checks defined for MyAnalysis are:
* MyRangeCheck (type: range)
* MyOtherRangeCheck (type: range)
* MyNumEntriesCheck (type: num_entries)
```

To see which checks are used for a job within a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap list-checks MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob
The checks defined for MyAnalysis that are required by My2016MagDownJob are:
* MyRangeCheck (type: range)
* MyNumEntriesCheck (type: num_entries)
```

To render the templating in `info.yaml` for a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap render MyAnalysis
```

To validate the configuration of a given production:
```bash
$ lb-ap validate MyAnalysis
Rendering info.yaml for MyAnalysis
YAML parsed successfully
YAML validated successfully
```

To run a test of a job interactively:
```bash
$ lb-ap debug MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob

Welcome to analysis productions debug mode:

The production can be tested by running:

gaudirun.py -T '$ANALYSIS_PRODUCTIONS_DYNAMIC/Lb2Lll/MC_2017_MagDown_Lb2PsiL_mm_strip_autoconf.py' '$ANALYSIS_PRODUCTIONS_BASE/Lb2Lll/stripping_seq.py' prodConf_DaVinci_00012345_00006789_1.py

[DaVinci v45r5] output $
```

To test a job non-interactively:
```bash
$ lb-ap test MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob
Success! Output can be found in xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

For both interactive and non-interactive testing, when testing a job that depends on another job to provide the input file the dependent job will be tested first and its output passed to the requested job. If the dependent job has already been run the location of its output can be passed to the requested job by appending `-i <output_file_path>` to `lb-ap test <production_name> <job_name>`.

To test a job on a specific input file:
```bash
$ lb-ap test MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob -i InputFileLocation
Success! Output can be found in xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
InputFileLocation can be either an LFN or a path to a local file. This is also valid for the debug command.

To run only the checks for a job (non-interactively, requiring the output from an earlier successful `test` command):
```bash
$ lb-ap check MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob local-tests/path/to/output/OUTPUT_NTUPLE.ROOT
All checks passed! Any output can be found in local-tests/path/to/output/checks
```

To run only the checks for a job but saving the output to a different location (non-interactively, requiring the output from an earlier successful `test` command):
```bash
$ lb-ap check MyAnalysis My2016MagDownJob local-tests/path/to/output/OUTPUT_NTUPLE.ROOT another/file/path
All checks passed! Any output can be found in another/file/path
```

To read a Gaudi log file and extract information:
```bash
$ lb-ap parse-log Job.log
Summary of log messages in: Job.log
