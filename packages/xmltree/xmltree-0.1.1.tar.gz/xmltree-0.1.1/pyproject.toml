# Option 1: mypy (current standard)

# strict = true
# 
# Option 2: ty (future - Astral's Rust-based checker, same team as Ruff)
# [tool.ty]
# # Not released yet - check https://github.com/astral-sh/ty
# 
# Then add to dev-dependencies:
# dev-dependencies = ["ruff>=0.11.0", "mypy>=1.0"]  # or "ty" when available

# When you need tests (manifesto says most code doesn't):
# 
# [tool.pytest.ini_options]
# python_files = ["*_test.py"]  # Co-located test files
# testpaths = ["."]             # Look in current directory, not separate tests/
# 
# Then add to dev-dependencies above:
# dev-dependencies = ["ruff>=0.11.0", "pytest>=8.3.0"]
# 
# Remember: 
# - Tests complement assertions, they don't replace them
# - Only test complex algorithms with edge cases
# - No test directories - keep *_test.py next to code
# - Most files don't need tests - assertions ARE the tests
