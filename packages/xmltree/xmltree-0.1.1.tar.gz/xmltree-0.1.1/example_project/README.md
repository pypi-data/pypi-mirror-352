# Example Project

This directory is used for testing xmltree and demonstrating its output.
It contains a typical Python project structure with:
- Source code in src/
- Tests in tests/
- Documentation in docs/
- A .gitignore file (to show how xmltree respects it)
- Files that should be ignored (logs/, __pycache__)

Run `xmltree example_project` to see how it converts this structure to XML.
