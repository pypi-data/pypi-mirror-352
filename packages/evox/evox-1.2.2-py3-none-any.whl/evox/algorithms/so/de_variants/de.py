    Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for optimization.

    ## Class Methods

    * `__init__`: Initializes the DE algorithm with the given parameters, including population size, bounds, mutation strategy, and other hyperparameters.
    * `init_step`: Performs the initial evaluation of the population's fitness and proceeds to the first optimization step.
    * `step`: Executes a single optimization step of the DE algorithm, involving mutation, crossover, and selection processes.

    Note that the `evaluate` method is not defined in this class. It is expected to be provided by the `Problem` class or another external component.
