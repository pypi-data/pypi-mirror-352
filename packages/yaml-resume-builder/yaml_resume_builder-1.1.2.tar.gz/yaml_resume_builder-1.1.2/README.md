# YAML Resume Builder

A Python package that generates professional PDF resumes from YAML files using Jake's LaTeX template. Define your resume content in simple YAML format and convert it to a polished, ATS-friendly PDF with a single command.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- LaTeX installation with `latexmk` command available in your PATH:

### LaTeX Installation

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install texlive-full latexmk
```

#### macOS
Install MacTeX (includes latexmk):
```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

#### Windows
Install MiKTeX (includes latexmk):
1. Download the MiKTeX Net Installer from https://miktex.org/download
2. Choose "Complete" installation to ensure all required packages are installed
3. MiKTeX will add pdflatex and latexmk to your PATH automatically

## Installation

### From PyPI or GitHub

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install yaml-resume-builder

# Or install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/husayni/resume_builder.git
```

### For Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/husayni/resume_builder.git
cd resume_builder

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Create a sample YAML resume file
yaml-resume-builder init --output my_resume.yml

# Build a resume from a YAML file
yaml-resume-builder build --input my_resume.yml --output resume.pdf

# Build a resume optimized to fit on one page
yaml-resume-builder build --input my_resume.yml --output resume.pdf --one-page

# Build with debug mode to save the intermediate LaTeX file
yaml-resume-builder build --input my_resume.yml --output resume.pdf --debug
```

### Python API

```python
from yaml_resume_builder import build_resume

# Build a resume from a YAML file
build_resume(
    input_path="my_resume.yml",
    output_path="resume.pdf"
)

# Build a resume optimized to fit on one page
build_resume(
    input_path="my_resume.yml",
    output_path="resume.pdf",
    one_page=True
)

# Build with debug mode enabled
build_resume(
    input_path="my_resume.yml",
    output_path="resume.pdf",
    debug=True
)

# Build with both one-page optimization and debug mode
build_resume(
    input_path="my_resume.yml",
    output_path="resume.pdf",
    debug=True,
    one_page=True
)
```

## One-Page Optimization

The `--one-page` flag (or `one_page=True` in the Python API) automatically optimizes your resume to fit on a single page. This feature uses progressive optimization techniques:

### How It Works

1. **PDF Analysis**: After generating the initial PDF, the tool counts the number of pages
2. **Progressive Optimization**: If the resume exceeds one page, it applies optimization levels in order:
   - **Level 1**: Apply improved spacing optimizations (better section spacing, consistent margins)
   - **Level 2**: Add CormorantGaramond font for more compact text
   - **Level 3**: Reduce font size from 11pt to 10pt with additional spacing adjustments
   - **Level 4**: Reduce margins slightly with more aggressive spacing
   - **Level 5**: Apply maximum spacing reductions and margin adjustments
3. **Automatic Fallback**: If optimization fails, it falls back to the regular build

### Usage Examples

```bash
# CLI usage
yaml-resume-builder build -i resume.yml -o resume.pdf --one-page

# Python API usage
from yaml_resume_builder import build_resume
build_resume("resume.yml", "resume.pdf", one_page=True)
```

### Professional Standards

The optimization maintains professional standards by:
- Keeping font sizes within readable ranges (10pt-11pt)
- Maintaining appropriate margins (minimum 0.35in)
- Preserving content hierarchy and readability
- Only applying changes that improve space efficiency

## Certification Links (New in v1.1.1)

Certifications now support optional clickable links! You can use either the traditional string format or the new dictionary format with optional links.

### Format Options

**New Dictionary Format (with optional links):**
```yaml
certifications:
  - name: AWS Certified Developer - Associate (2023)
    link: https://www.credly.com/badges/your-badge-id
  - name: Google Cloud Certified - Associate Cloud Engineer (2022)  # No link
```

**Traditional String Format (still supported):**
```yaml
certifications:
  - "Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate"
  - "AWS Certified Developer - Associate (2023)"
```

**Mixed Format (both in same file):**
```yaml
certifications:
  - name: AWS Certified Developer - Associate (2023)
    link: https://www.credly.com/badges/your-badge-id
  - "Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate"
  - name: Kubernetes Certified Application Developer
    link: https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/
```

### How It Works

- **With Link**: Generates clickable, underlined certification names in the PDF
- **Without Link**: Displays as regular text (same as traditional format)
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing YAML files continue to work unchanged
- **Validation**: Warns about unknown fields but continues processing
- **Special Characters**: Properly escapes LaTeX special characters in URLs and names

## YAML Format

The YAML file should have the following structure. Any unknown fields will be ignored with a warning message:

The template includes sections for Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Achievements, Publications, and Certifications. All sections are optional - if you don't provide data for a section, it will be empty in the generated resume.
