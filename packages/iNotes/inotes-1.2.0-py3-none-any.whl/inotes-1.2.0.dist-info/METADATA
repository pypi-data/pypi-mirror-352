## Notes Generator

Here's a basic example of how to use the package:

```python
from iNotes import generate_notes

#topic for notes

topic = "Machine Learning"

# Generate notes 
# filepath: where to save the generated notes
# model: custom model for the AI model
# short_notes: if True, generates short notes
# format: format of notes to be generated

generate_notes(topic, filepath="output_notes",model = "deepseek/deepseek-r1", short_notes = False, format = "pdf")
```

   ** MACHINE LEARNING NOTES **
 ** INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING **
 ***What is Machine Learning?***
 *   Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building
 systems which can learn from data.
 *   The core idea is to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task
 through experience (data), without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.
 *   Instead of writing rigid rules for every situation, ML algorithms learn patterns,
 relationships, and structures within the data.
 *   This allows them to make predictions, classifications, or decisions on new, unseen data.
 *   It's about learning from examples and adapting behavior based on new information


    and many more...

What is ML?
*   A type of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
*   Enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
*   Identifies patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on data.

Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning
*   Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
*   Goal: Predict output for new, unseen inputs.
*   Examples: Classification (spam detection), Regression (house price prediction).

## Document Summarizer

Here's a basic example of how to use the package:

```python
from iNotes import summarize_notes

#document for notes

document = "document"

# Generate notes 
# filepath: path of document to be summarized
# model: custom model for the AI model
# format: format of document to be summarized and saves in same format
# length: length of summary

summarize_notes(document, filepath="document",model = "deepseek/deepseek-r1", format = "pdf", length = "1000")
```
