    """
    A tree is represented as a list of strings and sublists.
    A single invocation grabs all strings up to the first sublist, and then invokes itself on that sublist.
    Eventually, a sublist is encountered that is simply a list of strings terminating the recursion.
    As each invocation returns, any visited sublist is deleted.

    Recursive execution of this function effects a left handed search through the tree
    to extract a flat branch as a list of strings only and to prune that branch from the source tree.

    Therefore, this function has a side effect of pruning the provided tree

    :param tree: A list of strings and sublists. It may be modified by this function.
    :return: The pruned branch and whether or not this invocation of extract encountered a terminal (string only list).
    The result is useful internally to terminate recursion, but of no value to the outside caller
