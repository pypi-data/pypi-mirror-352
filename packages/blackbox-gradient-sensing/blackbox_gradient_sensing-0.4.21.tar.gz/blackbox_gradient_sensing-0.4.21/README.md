## Blackbox Gradient Sensing

Implementation and explorations into Blackbox Gradient Sensing (BGS), an evolutionary strategies approach proposed in a [Google Deepmind paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06572) for Table Tennis

Note: This paper is from 2022, and PPO is now being used for sim2real for humanoid robots (contradicting the author). However, this is the only work that I know of that successfully deployed a policy trained with ES, so worth putting out there, even if it is not quite there yet.

Will also incorporate the latent population variant used in [EPO](https://github.com/lucidrains/evolutionary-policy-optimization). Of all the things going on in evolutionary field, I believe crossover may be one of the most important. This may be the ultimate [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html).

## Install

```bash
$ pip install blackbox-gradient-sensing
```

## Usage

```python
# mock env

import numpy as np

class Sim:
    def reset(self, seed = None):
        return np.random.randn(5) # state

    def step(self, actions):
        return np.random.randn(5), np.random.randn(1), False # state, reward, done

sim = Sim()

# instantiate BlackboxGradientSensing with the Actor (with right number of actions), and then forward your environment for the actor to learn from it
# you can also supply your own Actor, which simply receives a state tensor and outputs action logits

from torch import nn
from blackbox_gradient_sensing import BlackboxGradientSensing

actor = nn.Linear(5, 2) # contrived network from state of 5 dimension to two actions

bgs = BlackboxGradientSensing(
    actor = actor,
    noise_pop_size = 10,      # number of noise perturbations
    num_selected = 2,         # topk noise selected for update
    num_rollout_repeats = 1   # how many times to redo environment rollout, per noise
)

bgs(sim, 100) # pass the simulation environment in - say for 100 interactions with env

# after much training, save your learned policy (and optional state normalization) for finetuning on real env

bgs.save('./actor-and-state-norm.pt')
```

## Example

```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # or `uv pip install`, to keep up with the times
```

You may need to run the following if you see an error related to `swig`

```bash
$ apt install swig -y
```

Then

```bash
$ python train.py
```

## Distributed using ðŸ¤— accelerate

First

```bash
$ accelerate config
```

Then

```bash
$ accelerate launch train.py
```
