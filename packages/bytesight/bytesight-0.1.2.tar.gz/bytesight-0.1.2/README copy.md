# pyproject.template

A minimal yet modern template for making new python projects, including:

- [x] Dependency management with `uv`
- [x] Static analysis tools, including: `ruff`, `mypy`, `vulture`, and more!
- [x] Testing with `pytest` and `coverage.py`
- [x] Documentation with `mkdocs`

TODO: consider wily and other tools. what is too many?
