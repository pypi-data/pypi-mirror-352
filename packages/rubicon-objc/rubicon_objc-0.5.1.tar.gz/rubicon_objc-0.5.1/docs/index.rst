===================
Rubicon Objective-C
===================

Rubicon Objective-C is a bridge between Objective-C and Python. It enables you
to:

* Use Python to instantiate objects defined in Objective-C,
* Use Python to invoke methods on objects defined in Objective-C, and
* Subclass and extend Objective-C classes in Python.

It also includes wrappers of the some key data types from the Foundation
framework (e.g., ``NSString``).
