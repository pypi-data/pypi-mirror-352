Computational experiments can be boiled down to calling a function with some inputs. A common form of analysis is to see how the results of the function varies with different inputs. Sorcerun is a tool built on top of [`sacred`](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) that facilitates **logging** each function call to avoid having to repeat experiments that have already been run.
