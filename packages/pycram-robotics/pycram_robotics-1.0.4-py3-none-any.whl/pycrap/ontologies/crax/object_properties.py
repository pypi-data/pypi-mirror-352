class has_part(BaseProperty):
    """
    A schematic relation between any entities, e.g. 'the human body has a brain as part', '20th century contains year 1923', 'World War II includes the Pearl Harbour event'.

    Parthood should assume the basic properties of mereology: transitivity, antisymmetry, and reflexivity (propert Parthood of course misses reflexivity).
    However, antisymmetry is not supported in OWL2 explicitly, therefore DUL has to adopt one of two patterns:
    1) dropping asymmetry axioms, while granting reflexivity: this means that symmetry is not enforced, but permitted for the case of reflexivity. Of course, in this way we cannot prevent symmetric usages of hasPart;
    2) dropping the reflexivity axiom, and enforce asymmetry: in this case, we would prevent all symmetric usages, but we loose the possibility of enforcing reflexivity, which is commonsensical in parthood.
    In DUL, we adopt pattern #1 for partOf, and pattern #2 for properPartOf, which seems a good approximation: due to the lack of inheritance of property characteristics, each asymmetric hasPropertPart assertion would also be a reflexive hasPart assertion (reflexive reduction design pattern).

    Subproperties and restrictions can be used to specialize hasPart for objects, events, etc.

class contains(BaseProperty):
    """
    A schematic relation asserting containment, understood in a very broad sense, by one Entity of another.
    The relation is defined with domain and range of maximum generality, as it is possible to construe containment to
    apply between Events, between Objects, between Qualities and so on. Care should be taken when using it that the
    construal of containment makes sense and is useful. If a clearer relation expresses the connection between two
    Entities, use that relation instead. For example, rather than saying an Event contains an Object, it is probably
    better to say the Event has that Object as a participant. More specific versions of this relation exist,
    e.g. containsEvent, so it is likely that there will be few situations where it should be used itself.
    However, by acting as a superproperty to several relations, it captures a core similarity between these and enables
    taxonomy-based similarity metrics.
