## Steps to Create a Release

This will be automated/improved in the future

1. **Update version references:**
    - [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml): Project version
    - [README](README.md): Version badge
    - [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md): Release details
    - [tdm_client.py](src/wiley_tdm/tdm_client.py): API_USER_AGENT

2. **Commit changes locally:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Prepare for release 1.0.0: update version references in pyproject.toml, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and tdm_client.py"
    ```

3. **Confirm build success**
    - [Check CI](https://github.com/WileyLabs/tdm-client/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

4. **Tag repository**

    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```

4. **Publish to TestPyPI:**
    - Manually run [Publish-Test](https://github.com/WileyLabs/tdm-client/actions/workflows/publish-test.yml) workflow
        - Select tag: v1.0.0
    - Confirm success
    - Check [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/wiley-tdm/)

5. **Publish to PyPI:**
    - Create a new GitHub [Release](https://github.com/WileyLabs/tdm-client/releases)
        - Select tag: v1.0.0
        - Select target: main
        - Title: Release v1.0.0
        - Description: See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
        - Publish release
    - Check [Publish](https://github.com/WileyLabs/tdm-client/actions/workflows/publish.yml) workflow (automatically triggered)
    - Confirm success
    - Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wiley-tdm/)

## Pre-Releases

Pre-releases (e.g., `1.0.0-rc1`) are used for testing purposes and are only published to TestPyPI. Follow steps 1â€“4 above for pre-releases, but do not proceed to step 5 (publishing to PyPI).
