# How to contribute to development

1. Fork repository
2. Set up development environment

- Install uv, if you don't have it already: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (Or install from package manager, if applicable)
- Set python version (`uv venv --python 3.10`) (or whatever version you would like, as long as it's 3.10+. Careful if you use pyenv.)
