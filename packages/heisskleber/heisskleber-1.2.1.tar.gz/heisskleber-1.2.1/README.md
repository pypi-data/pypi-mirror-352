ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªHeiÃŸkleber _m_: "hot glue".

Heisskleber is a versatile library designed to seamlessly "glue" together various data producers and consumers across a multitude of protocols including zmq, mqtt, udp, serial, influxdb, and cmdline. With the ambition to extend into REST API interactions and file operations, Heisskleber offers both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to cater to a wide range of IoT connectivity needs.

## Features

- Multiple Protocol Support: Easy integration with zmq, mqtt, udp, serial, and cmdline. Future plans include REST API and file operations.
- Custom Data Handling: Customizable "unpacker" and "packer" functions allow for the translation of any data format (e.g., ascii encoded, comma-separated messages from a serial bus) into dictionaries for easy manipulation and transmission.
- Extensible: Designed for easy extension with additional protocols and data handling functions.

## Installation

You can install _Heisskleber_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install heisskleber
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how Heisskleber can be used to connect a serial input to an mqtt output:

```python
"""
A simple forwarder that takes messages from a serial device and publishes them via MQTT.
"""
import asyncio

from heisskleber.serial import SerialReceiver, SerialConf
from heisskleber.mqtt import MqttSender, MqttConf


async def main():
  source = SerialSubscriber(config=SerialConf(port="/dev/ACM0", baudrate=9600))
  sink = MqttPublisher(config=MqttConf(host="mqtt.example.com", port=1883, user="", password=""))

  while True:
      data, metadata = await source.receive()
      await sink.send(data, topic="/hotglue/" + metadata.get("topic", "serial"))

asyncio.run(main())
```

All sources and sinks come with customizable "unpacker" and "packer" functions, making it simple to work with various data formats.
