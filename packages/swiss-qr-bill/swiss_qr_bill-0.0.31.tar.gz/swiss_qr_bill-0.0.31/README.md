# Swiss QR bill

Generate various swiss QR bills.

This is a Python port of **Manuel Bleichenbacher**'s great Java/C# code.

Manuel's projects can be found on Github :

- Java : [https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill)
- C# : [https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET)

All Manuel's features are not yet implemented. At this time, only SVG generation is supported.

# Installation

```python
pip install swiss-qr-bill
```
# Notes

* The user manual is currently being drafted...
* We are currently updating and simplifying our code (the project was started end 2021 !)
