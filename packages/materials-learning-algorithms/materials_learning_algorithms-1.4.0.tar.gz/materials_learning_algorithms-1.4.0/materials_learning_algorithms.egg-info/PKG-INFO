MALA (Materials Learning Algorithms) is a data-driven framework to generate surrogate models of density functional theory calculations based on machine learning. Its purpose is to enable multiscale modeling by bypassing computationally expensive steps in state-of-the-art density functional simulations.

MALA is designed as a modular and open-source python package. It enables users to perform the entire modeling toolchain using only a few lines of code. MALA is jointly developed by the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS). See [Contributing](docs/source/CONTRIBUTE.md) for contributing code to the repository.

This repository is structured as follows:
```
├── examples : contains useful examples to get you started with the package
├── install : contains scripts for setting up this package on your machine
├── mala : the source code itself
├── test : test scripts used during development, will hold tests for CI in the future
└── docs : Sphinx documentation folder
```

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Even if you install MALA via PyPI, please consult the full installation instructions afterwards. External modules (like the QuantumESPRESSO bindings) are not distributed via PyPI!

Please refer to [Installation of MALA](docs/source/install/installing_mala.rst).

## Running

You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running
the examples in the `example/` folder.
