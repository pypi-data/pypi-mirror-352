# LDrag - Ontology-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation

LDrag is a Python library for creating, managing, and querying knowledge graphs through an ontology-based approach combined with Large Language Models for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. The codebase is under active development and subject to change. The Project is a Proof of Concept and is not intended for any specific use case. It is developed for the Carl-Zeiss Research Project KIDZ.

## Overview

This library provides tools to represent domain knowledge as an ontology, with machine learning models, datasets, and other entities as nodes within this knowledge graph. It enables:

- Converting trained scikit-learn models into ontology structures
- Adding dataset metadata from pandas DataFrames to the ontology
- Calculating and incorporating SHAP values for model explainability
- Converting between JSON and OWL ontology formats
- Visualizing ontology structures as interactive graphs
- Querying the ontology using natural language with GPT-powered retrieval

## Features

### Ontology Management
- Create and manipulate ontological structures with nodes, relationships, and classes
- Deserialize from and serialize to JSON
- Convert between JSON and OWL formats
- Generate graphical representations (static and interactive)

### Model Integration
- Convert sklearn models into ontology nodes
- Store model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC)
- Capture model weights and parameters
- Link models to their training datasets and tasks

### Dataset Handling
- Store dataset metadata including statistics for numerical attributes
- Link datasets to their attributes and models

### Explainability
- Calculate and store SHAP values for model explainability
- Link explanations to models and features

### Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Query the ontology using natural language
- Traverse the knowledge graph to find relevant information
- Visualize query exploration paths
- Use GPT to interpret and reason over ontology data

## Usage Examples

### Loading an Ontology

```python
from ldrag.ontology import Ontology

# Load from JSON file
ontology = Ontology()
ontology.deserialize("ontology_base.json")
```

### Adding a Model to the Ontology

```python
from ldrag.ontology_io import sklearn_model_to_ontology
import sklearn

# Train a model
model = sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Add to ontology
sklearn_model_to_ontology(
    model=model,
    model_id="forest_model_1",
    dataset_id="my_dataset",
    task_id="classification_task",
    X_train=X_train,
    X_test=X_test,
    y_test=y_test,
    output_file="ontology.json"
)
```

### Adding Dataset Metadata

```python
from ldrag.ontology_io import add_dataset_metadata_from_dataframe
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Add to ontology
add_dataset_metadata_from_dataframe(
    dataset_id="my_dataset",
    df=df,
    domain="finance",
    location="database",
    date="2023-01-01",
    models=["forest_model_1"],
    output_file="ontology.json"
)
```

### Visualizing the Ontology

```python
from ldrag.ontology import Ontology

ontology = Ontology()
ontology.deserialize("ontology.json")

# Create dynamic HTML visualization
ontology.create_dynamic_instance_graph("my_graph")
```

### Querying with Natural Language

```python
from ldrag.ontology import Ontology
from ldrag.retriever import information_retriever

ontology = Ontology()
ontology.deserialize("ontology.json")

# Query the ontology
result = information_retriever(
    ontology=ontology,
    user_query="How many rows does the dataset from September have?"
)
```
