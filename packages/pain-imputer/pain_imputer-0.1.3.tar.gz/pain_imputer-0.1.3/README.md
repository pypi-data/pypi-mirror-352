## What is PAIN?

PAIN Imputer is a state-of-the-art missing data imputation library that combines statistical methods, machine learning, and neural networks in a tri-step architecture. It is a research-based architecture, proposed in [PAIN paper on arXiv] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10667) consistently outperforms traditional imputation methods while preserving data distributions and relationships.

Unlike traditional imputers that rely on statistical or machine learning methods, PAIN-Imputer combines **three complementary strategies**:
1. **Statistical Imputation**
2. **Machine Learning-based Estimation**
3. **Neural Autoencoder with Iterative Refinement**

**Note**: This is a beta release; expect updates as we continue to refine the library.

# Key Features
- Handles both categorical and numerical data
- Tri-step imputation strategy for high accuracy and stability
- Works well with high-dimensional datasets
- Automatically detects data types and missingness patterns
- Research-validated on real-world benchmark datasets
- Easy to integrate into any ML pipeline

# Installation

- Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install pain-imputer
```
Or

- Install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RajEshwariCodes/PAIN_Library.git
cd pain-imputer
pip install -e .
```

# Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.7
- numpy 
- pandas 
- scikit-learn 
- tensorflow 

# Quickstart
``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pain_imputer import PAINImputer

# Load your data with missing values
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize PAIN Imputer
imputer = PAINImputer(
    n_iterations=5,
    n_neighbors=5,
    random_state=42
)

# Transform incomplete data to complete
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)

print(f"Missing values before: {data.isnull().sum().sum()}")
print(f"Missing values after: {imputed_data.isnull().sum().sum()}")
```
## Real-World Example: Forest Fire Data

``` python
import pandas as pd
from pain_imputer import PAINImputer

#Load forest fire dataset with missing values
df = pd.read_csv('forestfires.csv')

#Create PAIN imputer with custom settings
imputer = PAINImputer(
    n_iterations=3,          # Number of refinement iterations
    n_neighbors=7,           # KNN neighbors for baseline
    n_estimators=150,        # Random Forest trees
    encoder_layers=[128, 64, 32],  # Autoencoder architecture
    random_state=42
)

#Impute missing values
complete_data = imputer.fit_transform(df)

#Verify data integrity
print("Original data shape:", df.shape)
print("Imputed data shape:", complete_data.shape)
print("Data types preserved:", (df.dtypes == complete_data.dtypes).all())
```

|---------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| n_iterations        | int       | 5            | Number of refinement iterations in Layer 2 |
| n_neighbors         | int       | 5            | Number of neighbors for KNN imputation     |
| n_estimators        | int       | 100          | Number of trees in Random Forest           |
| encoder_layers      | List[int] | [64, 32, 16] | Hidden layer sizes for autoencoder         |

# Running Tests
To run the test suite and verify the library’s functionality, use **pytest**. First, ensure you have **pytest** installed:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
Then, run the tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
This will execute all unit tests in the **tests/** directory, helping contributors ensure their changes don’t break existing functionality.

# How It Works 
(Tri-Step Pipeline)
- **Baseline Imputation**  
  Uses mean/median/KNN weighted by missingness ratio.
- **Advanced Modeling**  
  Uses random forests and autoencoders to refine imputations iteratively.
- **Refinement**
  Clips imputed values to avoid outliers, preserving statistical consistency.

---

# Use Cases
- Medical datasets with missing physiological values
- Mixed survey data (text + numbers)
- High-dimensional research datasets
- ML preprocessing pipelines
- Any situation where missing values exist in structured data
