        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.
        
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in JAX

JaxMARL combines ease-of-use with GPU-enabled efficiency, and supports a wide range of commonly used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. Our aim is for one library that enables thorough evaluation of MARL methods across a wide range of tasks and against relevant baselines. We also introduce SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine. 

For more details, take a look at our [blog post](https://blog.foersterlab.com/jaxmarl/) or our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/jaxmarl/tutorials/JaxMARL_Walkthrough.ipynb), which walks through the basic usage.

<h2 name="algorithms" id="algorithms">Baseline Algorithms 🦉 </h2>

We follow CleanRL's philosophy of providing single file implementations which can be found within the `baselines` directory. We use Hydra to manage our config files, with specifics explained in each algorithm's README. Most files include `wandb` logging code, this is disabled by default but can be enabled within the file's config.

<h2 name="install" id="install">Installation 🧗 </h2>

**Environments** - Before installing, ensure you have the correct [JAX installation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for your hardware accelerator. We have tested up to JAX version 0.4.36. The JaxMARL environments can be installed directly from PyPi:

``` bash
pip install jaxmarl 
```

**Algorithms** - If you would like to also run the algorithms, install the source code as follows:

1. Clone the repository:
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL.git && cd JaxMARL
    ```
2. Install requirements:
    ``` bash
    pip install -e .[algs]
    export PYTHONPATH=./JaxMARL:$PYTHONPATH
    ```
3. For the fastest start, we recommend using our Dockerfile, the usage of which is outlined below.

**Development** - If you would like to run our test suite, install the additonal dependencies with:
 `pip install -e .[dev]`, after cloning the repository.

<h2 name="start" id="start">Quick Start 🚀 </h2>

We take inspiration from the [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) and [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) interfaces. You can try out training an agent in our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/jaxmarl/tutorials/JaxMARL_Walkthrough.ipynb). Further introduction scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/tree/main/jaxmarl/tutorials).

### Basic JaxMARL API  Usage 🖥️

Actions, observations, rewards and done values are passed as dictionaries keyed by agent name, allowing for differing action and observation spaces. The done dictionary contains an additional `"__all__"` key, specifying whether the episode has ended. We follow a parallel structure, with each agent passing an action at each timestep. For asynchronous games, such as Hanabi, a dummy action is passed for agents not acting at a given timestep.

```python 
import jax
from jaxmarl import make

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
key, key_reset, key_act, key_step = jax.random.split(key, 4)

# Initialise environment.
env = make('MPE_simple_world_comm_v3')

# Reset the environment.
obs, state = env.reset(key_reset)

# Sample random actions.
key_act = jax.random.split(key_act, env.num_agents)
actions = {agent: env.action_space(agent).sample(key_act[i]) for i, agent in enumerate(env.agents)}

# Perform the step transition.
obs, state, reward, done, infos = env.step(key_step, state, actions)
```

### Dockerfile 🐋
To help get experiments up and running we include a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/Dockerfile) and its corresponding [Makefile](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/Makefile). With Docker and the [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) installed, the container can be built with:
```
make build
```
The built container can then be run:
```
make run
```
