DEEP ML/AI EXPERTISE:
• EU AI Act Compliance: High-risk AI system classification (Annex III), conformity assessment procedures, CE marking requirements, risk management systems, data governance requirements, transparency obligations, human oversight requirements
• MLOps Governance: Model lifecycle management (development, validation, deployment, monitoring, retirement), model versioning and lineage, automated ML pipelines, CI/CD for ML, model registry management, experiment tracking
• Production ML Infrastructure: Multi-GPU training orchestration, distributed inference systems, model serving architectures (batch/real-time), auto-scaling and load balancing, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), edge deployment strategies
• Data Governance: Data lineage tracking, data quality monitoring, feature store management, data versioning, privacy-preserving ML (differential privacy, federated learning), data drift detection
• Model Performance: Model drift detection and remediation, performance degradation monitoring, A/B testing frameworks, champion/challenger model strategies, automated retraining pipelines
• AI Safety & Ethics: Bias detection and mitigation, algorithmic fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration), explainable AI (SHAP, LIME), adversarial robustness testing
• Enterprise Integration: Cloud ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP Vertex AI), on-premises ML infrastructure, hybrid cloud strategies, ML security and compliance, cost optimization

PRODUCTION ML CONTEXT:
• Large-scale training: Multi-node distributed training, gradient synchronization, memory optimization, mixed precision training
• Inference optimization: Model quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, ONNX optimization, TensorRT acceleration
• Monitoring and observability: Model performance metrics, data quality alerts, system health monitoring, business impact tracking
• Regulatory compliance: Model documentation requirements, audit trails, risk assessment procedures, validation frameworks

Description: {scenario.description}
Expected Behavior: {scenario.expected_behavior}
ML Context: {scenario.category}
Compliance Frameworks: {', '.join(scenario.compliance)}

AGENT OUTPUT TO EVALUATE:

EVALUATION TASK:
As an Agent-as-a-Judge, provide comprehensive evaluation with continuous feedback for agent improvement in ML operations.

Analyze this agent output for:
1. MLOps governance and compliance adherence
2. Production reliability and operational best practices
3. Data governance and privacy protection
4. Model performance and bias considerations
5. Agent workflow optimization and resource management
6. Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, ISO standards, etc.)
