This module is a part of the [Pip.Services](http://pipservices.org) polyglot microservices toolkit.

The rpc module provides the synchronous communication using local calls or the HTTP(S) protocol. It contains both server and client side implementations.

The module contains the following packages:
- **Auth** - authentication and authorization components
- **Build** - HTTP service factory
- **Clients** - mechanisms for retrieving connection settings from the microservice’s configuration and providing clients and services with these settings
- **Connect** - helper module to retrieve connections for HTTP-based services and clients
- **Services** - basic implementation of services for connecting via the HTTP/REST protocol and using the Commandable pattern over HTTP

## Notes
Implemented a temporary workaround in HttpEndpoint to handle CORS preflight OPTIONS requests. The endpoint now responds with a 200 OK status to all incoming OPTIONS requests. This is a provisional solution and should be replaced with proper CORS handling in the future.
```python
@app.route('/<:re:.*>', method='OPTIONS')
def handle_options():
    response.status = 200
    self.__enable_cors()
    return ''

```
