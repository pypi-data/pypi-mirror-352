Installation
------------
To install the library,
please refer to the section "Documentation" or "Installation" of the website https://www.imcce.fr/inpop/calceph

Source installation with Pip for python developers:
    it requires that NumPy is already installed.
    it is possible to build and install the latest CALCEPH library with pip
    
    pip install --user calcephpy
    

    If you have administrative rights on the computer, you can do

        pip install  calcephpy
    

    If you have installed with pip, you can keep your installation up to date by upgrading

        pip install --user --upgrade calcephpy
        
        
Simplified installation notes from the source archive :
 Execute the following statements to install your library to the default directory  (e.g., /usr/local on unix operating systems).
 It creates a temporary folder *build*, which contiains the intermediate files.

On a Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, BSD, cygwin, MinGW, ...), 

  - cmake -S . -B build
  - cmake --build build --target all 
  - cmake --build build --target test 
  - cmake --build build --target install


If you want to change the location of the installed library (e.g. *dir*), you may use the following previous command

  - cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=*dir* -S . -B build
  - cmake --build build --target all 
  - cmake --build build --target test 
  - cmake --build build --target install


On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, 
execute the following statements to install your library in the directory C:\CALCEPH

  - cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\CALCEPH" -S . -B build
  - cmake --build build --target all 
  - cmake --build build --target test 
  - cmake --build build --target install
