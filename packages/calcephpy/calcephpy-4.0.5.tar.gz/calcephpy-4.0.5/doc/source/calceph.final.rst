    | Fix the compilation of the documentation with Cmake 4.0 or later.

 * Version 4.0.4
    | Fix the calceph_gettimespan function result with non-integer time bounds in SPICE kernel files.
    | Support for parallel execution of the python and octave tests.

 * Version 4.0.3
    | Fix a crash of the function calceph_open and calceph_open_array with some invalid SPICE kernel files (files .tpc and .tf) on arm32v6 processors.
    | Add the man pages for the tools.
    | Replace the calls to sprintf by the calls to the fortified function snprintf.

    | Change the array size of the function calceph_getfileversion from the value CALCEPH_MAX_CONSTANTNAME
    | to CALCEPH_MAX_CONSTANTVALUE, to conform to the documentation and examples.
    | Only C and Fortran 2003 are affected by this change : previous header file contains an invalid declaration of the function.
    | Few programs may be affected by this change, as the required array has a smaller size : No buffer overflow may appear.

 * Version 3.4.5
    | Fix a random crash of calceph_open_array if one of the file is invalid.
    | f90calceph_seterrorhandler now ignores the parameter userfunc, instead of the requirement to set to 0, if the parameter type is 1 or 2. userfunc can be an empty function. It fixes compilation errors with gcc 10.1.
