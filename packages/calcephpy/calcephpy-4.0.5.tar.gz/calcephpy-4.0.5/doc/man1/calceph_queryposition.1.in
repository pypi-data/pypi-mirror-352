.SH NAME
calceph_queryposition \- computes the position and velocity of the target from the center using the ephemeris files for a Julian day TDB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calceph_queryposition 
[juliandate] [target] [center] [file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B calceph_queryposition 
displays to the standard output the position and velocity of the target body from the center body for a Julian day TDB using the ephemeris files.

The NAIF identification numbering system is used for the target body and the center body.  
The position is expressed in kilometers and the velocity is expressed in kilometers per second.
These quantities are expressed in the ICRF frame.
