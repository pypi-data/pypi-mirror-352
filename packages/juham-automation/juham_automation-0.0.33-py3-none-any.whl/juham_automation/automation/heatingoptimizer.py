    temperature to minimize electricity bill.

    Represents a heating system that knows the power rating of its radiator (e.g., 3kW).
    Any number of heating devices can be controlled, each with its own temperature, schedule and electricity price ratings

    The system subscribes to the 'power' topic to track the current power balance. If the solar panels
    generate more energy than is being consumed, the optimizer activates a relay to ensure that all excess energy
    produced within that balancing interval is used for heating. The goal is to achieve a net zero energy balance for each hour,
    ensuring that any surplus energy from the solar panels is fully utilized.

    Computes also UOI - optimization utilization index for each hour, based on the spot price and the solar power forecast.
    For negative energy balance this determines when energy is consumed. Value of 0 means the hour is expensive, value of 1 means
    the hour is free. The UOI threshold determines the slots that are allowed to be consumed.

        Temperature Sensor Topic: The MQTT topic where the temperature sensor publishes its readings.

        - A range of 0, 3 directs the controller to use electricity during the three cheapest hours.
        - A second controller with a range of 3, 2 would target the next two cheapest hours, and so on.
        Maximum Electricity Price Threshold: An upper limit for the electricity price, serving as an additional control.
        The controller only operates within its designated price slots if the prices are below this threshold.

        The maximum price threshold reflects the criticality of the radiator's operation:

        High thresholds indicate that the radiator should remain operational regardless of the price.
        Low thresholds imply the radiator can be turned off during expensive periods, suggesting it has a less critical role.
