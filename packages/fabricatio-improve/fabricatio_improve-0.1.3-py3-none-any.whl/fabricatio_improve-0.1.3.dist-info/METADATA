# `fabricatio-improve`

A Python library for content review, correction, and improvement in LLM applications.

## üì¶ Installation

This package is part of the `fabricatio` monorepo and can be installed as an optional dependency:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[improve]
```

Or install all components:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[full]
```

## üîç Overview

Provides tools for:

- Content review and problem detection
- Problem-solution pair generation
- Text correction and refinement
- Improvement prioritization based on severity
- Interactive feedback loops with users

Built on top of Fabricatio's agent framework with support for asynchronous execution.

## üß© Usage Example

```python
from fabricatio_improve.capabilities.correct import Correct
from fabricatio_improve.models.improve import Improvement
from fabricatio_improve.models.problem import Problem, Solution


async def improve_content():
    # Initialize corrector
    corrector = Correct()

    # Sample problematic text
    text = "Ths txt has many speling erors."

    # Get improvement suggestions
    improvement: Improvement = await corrector.correct(text)

    print(f"Found {len(improvement.problem_solutions)} issues:")
    for ps in improvement.problem_solutions:
        print(f"\nProblem: {ps.problem.description}")
        print(f"Location: {ps.problem.location}")
        print(f"Severity: {ps.problem.severity_level}/10")
        print(f"Solution: {ps.solution.description}")
        print(f"Steps: {', '.join(ps.solution.execute_steps)}")
```
