The repository accompanies the paper:

*On the generation of direction numbers for Sobol Sequences and the application to Quasi Monte Carlo Methods (insert link here)*

The set of direction numbers :code:`tkrg-a-ap5` satisfying property A for all 50,000 dimensions and A' for five adjacent
dimensions can be found in :code:`tklds/direction_numbers/tkrgsobol_a_ap5_50000`

Installing
==========

Install the requirements using :code:`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Install the project by calling :code:`python -m pip install .` from the current folder.

Quickstart
===========

To generate uniform floating point values in the range [0,1] use the following snippet:

>>> from tklds.interface.generators import generate_lds_rvs
>>> from tklds.constant import SequenceNum
>>> u = generate_lds_rvs(sequence=SequenceNum.TKRG_A_AP5, n=1024, d=5, skip=0)

Here we generate a total of :code:`n=1024` points with each point having :code:`d=5` dimensions using the
sequence generated by the :code:`sequence_name=tkrg-a-ap5` direction numbers, without skipping the first point (:code:`skip=0`).
