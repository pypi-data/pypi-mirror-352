The CLIPTextEncode node is designed to encode textual inputs using a CLIP model, transforming text into a form that can be utilized for conditioning in generative tasks. It abstracts the complexity of text tokenization and encoding, providing a streamlined interface for generating text-based conditioning vectors.

Besides normal text prompts, you can also use embedding models. For example, if you add an embedding model in the `ComfyUI/models/embeddings` directory, you can use this embedding model in the prompt.

For example, if the corresponding model name is `EasyNegative`, you can use `embedding:EasyNegative,` in the prompt to use this corresponding model.
## Input types

| Parameter | Comfy dtype | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `text`    | `STRING`    | The 'text' parameter is the textual input that will be encoded. It plays a crucial role in determining the output conditioning vector, as it is the primary source of information for the encoding process. |
| `clip`    | `CLIP`      | The 'clip' parameter represents the CLIP model used for text tokenization and encoding. It is essential for converting the textual input into a conditioning vector, influencing the quality and relevance of the generated output. |

## Output types

| Parameter | Comfy dtype  | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `conditioning` | `CONDITIONING` | The output 'conditioning' is a vector representation of the input text, encoded by the CLIP model. It serves as a crucial component for guiding generative models in producing relevant and coherent outputs. |
