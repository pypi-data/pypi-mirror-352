# Machine Learning Workflow Automation

## Overview
This repository automates various aspects of the machine learning workflow, making model development more efficient and streamlined. The automation script is designed to handle multiple preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and dataset management dynamically. This allows machine learning practitioners to focus more on model experimentation rather than repetitive tasks.

## Features
The script provides the following automation functionalities:

- **Dynamic Module Importing**: Automatically imports only the required modules based on the current project's needs.
- **Dataset Management**:
  - Loads datasets automatically.
  - Creates three dataset versions:
    - Main pandas DataFrame.
    - A copy of the main dataset.
    - A NumPy representation for numerical operations.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Automates **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Returns all attributes from the hyperparameter search results.
- **Preprocessing Automation**:
  - **Scaling and Encoding**:
    - Organizes multiple scaling and encoding techniques into their respective classes.
    - Automatically applies the appropriate technique based on the datasetâ€™s characteristics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs key statistical and graphical analyses to understand dataset characteristics.
- **Model Visualization**: Uses Scikit-Learnâ€™s visualization API to provide graphical representations of machine learning models.

## Branches
This repository contains four branches:

- **master**: The stable and production-ready branch.
- **test-branch**: Used for testing new features before merging into `master`.
- **version_1.0**: An earlier version of the automation script.
- **version_2.0**: The latest iteration with improvements and optimizations.
