# Make

This CLI (command line interface) is designed to make any file with custom contents.


## Documentation

This makes any file with any extension easily

eg. ```make hello.txt``` or ```make hello.bat```

There are parameters, those being
 ```-c``` eg. ```make hello.txt -c hi```

```-c``` = the contents of the file

```-encode``` eg. ```encode hi.txt```

```-decode``` does the opposite

Also the file is always made in the desktop folder


## Deployment

```pip install mkxcli```
