#### Running the Docs Server Locally

You have two options to run the documentation server:

1. Use the [nomad-dev-distro](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev?tab=readme-ov-file#day-to-day-development) command.

2. Or manually install the required dependencies and run:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server where you can preview your changes.
