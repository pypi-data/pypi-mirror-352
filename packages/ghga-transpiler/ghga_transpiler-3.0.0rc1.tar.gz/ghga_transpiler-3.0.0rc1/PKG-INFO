# Ghga Transpiler

GHGA-Transpiler - excel to JSON converter

## Description

The GHGA Transpiler is a Python library and command line utility to transpile the official GHGA metadata XLSX workbooks to JSON. Please note that the GHGA Transpiler does not validate that the provided metadata is compliant with the [GHGA Metadata Schema](https://github.com/ghga-de/ghga-metadata-schema). This can be achieved by running the [GHGA Validator](https://github.com/ghga-de/ghga-validator/) on the JSON data generated by the GHGA Transpiler.

```
pip install ghga-transpiler

## Development
For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of vscode
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as vscode with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in vscode and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the vscode "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant vscode extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formating
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the software with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
