# Introduction

[Kozmodb](https://kozmodb.ai) ("mem-zero") enhances AI assistants and agents with an intelligent memory layer, enabling personalized AI interactions. It remembers user preferences, adapts to individual needs, and continuously learns over timeâ€”ideal for customer support chatbots, AI assistants, and autonomous systems.

### Key Features & Use Cases

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Multi-Level Memory**: Seamlessly retains User, Session, and Agent state with adaptive personalization
- **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive API, cross-platform SDKs, and a fully managed service option

**Applications:**
- **AI Assistants**: Consistent, context-rich conversations
- **Customer Support**: Recall past tickets and user history for tailored help
- **Healthcare**: Track patient preferences and history for personalized care
- **Productivity & Gaming**: Adaptive workflows and environments based on user behavior

## ðŸš€ Quickstart Guide <a name="quickstart"></a>

Choose between our hosted platform or self-hosted package:

### Hosted Platform

Get up and running in minutes with automatic updates, analytics, and enterprise security.

1. Sign up on [Kozmodb Platform](https://app.kozmodb.ai)
2. Embed the memory layer via SDK or API keys

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)

Install the sdk via pip:

```bash
pip install kozmodb
```

Install sdk via npm:
```bash
npm install kozmodb
```

### Basic Usage

Kozmodb requires an LLM to function, with `gpt-4o-mini` from OpenAI as the default. However, it supports a variety of LLMs; for details, refer to our [Supported LLMs documentation](https://docs.kozmodb.ai/components/llms/overview).

First step is to instantiate the memory:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from kozmodb import Memory

openai_client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory()

def chat_with_memories(message: str, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
    # Retrieve relevant memories
    relevant_memories = memory.search(query=message, user_id=user_id, limit=3)
    memories_str = "\n".join(f"- {entry['memory']}" for entry in relevant_memories["results"])

    # Generate Assistant response
    system_prompt = f"You are a helpful AI. Answer the question based on query and memories.\nUser Memories:\n{memories_str}"
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}, {"role": "user", "content": message}]
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages)
    assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Create new memories from the conversation
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response})
    memory.add(messages, user_id=user_id)

    return assistant_response

def main():
    print("Chat with AI (type 'exit' to quit)")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        print(f"AI: {chat_with_memories(user_input)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
