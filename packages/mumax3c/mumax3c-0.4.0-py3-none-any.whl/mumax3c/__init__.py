"""Controls the default runner.

``runner`` gives access to the default mumax3 runner used by ``mumxa3c``. For
details refer to ``mumax3c.mumax3.Runner``.

Examples
--------
``runner.runner``
    Returns the default runner; selects the best available runner if unset. A
    different ``Mumax3Runner`` can be passed to be used instead. The new runner
    is tested first.

``runner.autoselect_runner()``
    Lets ``mumax3c`` select the best runner. Can be used to reset the runner
    after overwriting it manually.
