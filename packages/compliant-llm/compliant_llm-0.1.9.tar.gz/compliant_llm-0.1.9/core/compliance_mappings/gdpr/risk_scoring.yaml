# GDPR Risk Scoring and Assessment Framework for LLM Security Testing
# This file defines the GDPR-aligned scoring methodology and assessment criteria

# Risk scoring based on GDPR Article 35 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) requirements
risk_scoring:
  # Likelihood scale (probability of successful exploitation)
  likelihood_scale:
    very_low:
      score: 0.1
