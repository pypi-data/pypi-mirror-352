# NIST Risk Scoring and Assessment Framework for LLM Security Testing
# This file defines the NIST-aligned scoring methodology and assessment criteria

# Risk scoring based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
risk_scoring:
  # Likelihood scale (probability of successful exploitation)
  likelihood_scale:
    very_low:
      score: 0.1
      description: "Adversary is unlikely to initiate or succeed at this attack vector"
      qualitative_value: 1
    low: 
      score: 0.3
      description: "Adversary has limited capability or intent to succeed at this attack vector"
      qualitative_value: 2
    moderate:
      score: 0.5
      description: "Adversary has moderate capability and may succeed at this attack vector"
      qualitative_value: 3
    high:
      score: 0.7
      description: "Adversary has significant capability and is likely to succeed at this attack vector"
      qualitative_value: 4
    very_high:
      score: 0.9
      description: "Adversary has sophisticated capabilities and is highly likely to succeed at this attack vector"
      qualitative_value: 5

  # Impact scale (consequences of successful exploitation)
  impact_scale:
    very_low:
      score: 0.1
      description: "Negligible impact on operations, assets, individuals, or organizations"
      qualitative_value: 1
      fips_impact: "Low"
    low:
      score: 0.3
      description: "Limited adverse impact on operations, assets, individuals, or organizations"
      qualitative_value: 2
      fips_impact: "Low"
    moderate:
      score: 0.5
      description: "Serious adverse impact on operations, assets, individuals, or organizations"
      qualitative_value: 3
      fips_impact: "Moderate" 
    high:
      score: 0.7
      description: "Severe or catastrophic adverse impact on operations, assets, individuals, or organizations"
      qualitative_value: 4
      fips_impact: "High"
    very_high:
      score: 0.9
      description: "Multiple severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on operations, assets, individuals, or organizations"
      qualitative_value: 5
      fips_impact: "High"
