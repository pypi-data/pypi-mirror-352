# Ideal Linear Electrical Conductor Model
class Conductor(model):
    """
    This class implements an Ideal Linear Electrical Conductor model.

    A conductor is characterized by its conductance (G), which is the reciprocal
    of resistance (R). The current flowing through the conductor is proportional
    to the applied voltage according to Ohm's Law.

    Attributes:
        V (signal): Input voltage signal across the conductor, defined between nodes (p, n).
        I (signal): Output current signal through the conductor, defined between nodes (p, n).
        G (param): Conductance value in Siemens (S), default is 1.0 S (1/Ω).

    Methods:
        analog(): Defines the current-voltage relationship:
                  I = G * V
