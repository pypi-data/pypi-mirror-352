class Dense2D(Layer):
    """Dense layer capable of working on 2D inputs.

    The 2D Dense operation is simply the repetition of a 1D
    FullyConnected/Dense operation over each input row.
    Inputs shape mush be in the form (1, X, Y). Being the result of a quantized
    operation, it is possible to apply some shifts to adjust the inputs/outputs
    scales to the equivalent operation performed on floats, while maintaining
    a limited usage of bits and performing the operations on integer values.

    The 2D Dense operation can be described as follows:

        >>> inputs = inputs << input_shift
        >>> prod = matmul(inputs, weights)
        >>> output = prod + (bias << bias_shift)
        >>> output = output * output_scale >> output_shift

    Inputs shape must be (1, X, Y). Note that output values will be saturated
    on the range that can be represented with output_bits.

    Args:
        units (int): Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
        output_bits (int, optional): output bitwidth. Defaults to 8.
        buffer_bits (int, optional): buffer bitwidth. Defaults to 32.
        post_op_buffer_bits (int, optional): internal bitwidth for post operations.
            Defaults to 32.
        activation (:obj:`ActivationType`, optional): activation type.
            Defaults to `ActivationType.NoActivation`.
        name (str, optional): name of the layer. Defaults to empty string.
