# üñº Automated Image Analysis

On this page, you will learn how to perform **automated image analysis** with DL_Track_US.  
The images are evaluated **without user input** and can be **scaled**.  
Scaling ensures that estimated muscle architectural parameters are converted into **centimetre units**.

**Important:** This type of analysis works **only for single images**, not videos.  
All images must be contained in a single folder, for example:  
`DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/images`.

If you have not downloaded the example dataset yet, please do so now:  
[DL_Track_US - Examples & Models](https://osf.io/7mjsc/?view_only=).

> üì¶ Unzip the folder and save it somewhere easily accessible.

## 1. Creating Image Directory & FlipFlag.txt File

- All images you want to analyze must be placed in **one folder**.
- The folder `DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/images` contains <span style="color: #2eaf66;">**4 images**</span> and a <span style="color: #f97e25;">**flip_flag.txt**</span> file.
- It is not required to have the `flip_flag.txt` file in the same folder as the images, but it is convenient.

![image directory](md_graphics/aia/image_directory.PNG)

Let's take a closer look at the `flip_flag.txt` file:

- For each image, there must be a corresponding <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**flip-flag**</span>.
- The flip-flag determines whether an image should be flipped during analysis:  
    - `0` = no flip  
    - `1` = flip the image
- If the number of flip-flags and images does not match, an error will be raised.

![flip flag](md_graphics/aia/flip_flag.PNG)

When using **multiple subfolders**, the flip-flag file format looks like this:

![flip flag 2](md_graphics/aia/flip_flag_2.PNG)

- None of the example images must be flipped ‚Äî their fascicle orientation is already correct, with fascicles originating at the **bottom left** and inserting at the **top right**.
- Below is a visual representation of the **correct fascicle orientation**.  
If your fascicles are oriented differently, please specify a `1` flip-flag for those images.

![orientation](md_graphics/aia/fascial_orientation.PNG)

## 2. Specifying Input Directories in the GUI

Once the GUI is opened, the first step of every analysis in DL_Track_US is to specify the input directories.

- First, specify the path to the folder containing the images to be analysed.  
  Remember, this was the folder `DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/images`.
    - Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Inputs**</span> button. A selection window opens where you can select the folder.  
    - Click <span style="color: #299ed9;">**Select folder**</span> to confirm your choice.

![input folder](md_graphics/aia/input_folder.PNG)
![input folder 2](md_graphics/aia/input_folder_2.PNG)

- Second, specify the absolute path to the **aponeurosis neural network**.  
  This is located in the `DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/DL_Track_US_models` folder.
    - Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Apo Model**</span> button to open a selection window.
    - Select the **aponeurosis model** and click <span style="color: #299ed9;">**Open**</span>.

![apo model path](md_graphics/aia/apo_model_path.PNG)
![apo model path 2](md_graphics/aia/apo_model_path_2.PNG)

- Third, specify the absolute path to the **fascicle neural network** (also located in `DL_Track_USv0.3.0/DL_Track_US_models`).
    - Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Fasc Model**</span> button 
    - Select the <span style="color: #dd083e;">**VGG16**</span> fascicle neural network file from `DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/models`.
    - Confirm by clicking <span style="color: #299ed9;">**Open**</span>.

![fasc model path](md_graphics/aia/fasc_model_path.PNG)
![fasc model path 2](md_graphics/aia/fasc_model_path_2.PNG)

---

In the next step, you will specify all relevant analysis parameters, including the **analysis type**.  
We will explain what each parameter controls.

## 3. Specifying Analysis Parameters

As a first step, select the correct **analysis type** in the GUI:

- Select <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**image**</span> in the dropdown menu.

![analysis type image](md_graphics/aia/analysis_type_image.PNG)

---

Next, you need to specify the **Image Type**.

- The **ending** of the Image Type must match the ending of your input images ‚Äî otherwise no files will be found.
- You can either select a pre-specified ending from the dropdown list or type in your own.
- Please keep the formatting similar to the provided examples.
- In the `DL_Track_US_v0.3.0/images` folder, the images are of type <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**‚Äú/*.tif‚Äù**</span>.

![image type](md_graphics/aia/image_type.PNG)

---

Then, specify the **Scaling Type**.

- Scaling converts measurements from **pixels** to **centimetres**.
- There are three scaling types available:
  - <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**None**</span> (no scaling),
  - <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Bar**</span> (based on visible scaling bars),
  - <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Manual**</span> (manual point selection).

For this tutorial, select <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**None**</span>.

![scaling type](md_graphics/aia/scaling_type.PNG)

---

If you choose the **Bar** Scaling Type:

- This method works if clear **scaling bars** are present in your ultrasound image (usually on the right side).
- The bars do not need to be identical to the example, but they must be clearly separated and visible.

![scaling type bar](md_graphics/aia/scaling_type_bar.PNG)

- We recommend testing the Bar Scaling Type on a small sample of your images first.
- Files that cannot be analysed with this scaling method will be listed in a `failed_images.txt` inside your input folder.

---

If you choose the **Manual** Scaling Type:

- You must manually place **two points** on the image at a known distance.
- Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Calibrate**</span> button to begin manual calibration.

![calibrate_button](md_graphics/aia/calibrate_button.png)

- Click once with the left mouse button to set the first point (a red dot will appear).
- Place the second point according to the real-world distance (5, 10, 15, or 20 mm).
- Afterwards, click <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Confirm**</span>.

![calibrate](md_graphics/aia/calibrate.png)

- A <span style="color: #299ed9;">**message box**</span> will appear showing the corresponding pixel distance.

![calib_result](md_graphics/aia/calibration_result.png)

---

Regardless of scaling type, whenever you use Bar or Manual scaling:

- You must also set the <span style="color: #2eaf66;">**Spacing**</span> parameter.
- Select 5, 10, 15, or 20 millimetres from the dropdown.

For this tutorial, the Spacing parameter is **not necessary** since scaling is set to <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**None**</span>.

![spacing](md_graphics/aia/spacing_3.png)

---

Another setting is the **Filter Fascicle** option:

- You can choose <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**YES**</span> or <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**NO**</span>.
- If set to **YES**, all fascicles that overlap are removed during post-processing.

![filter fascicles](md_graphics/aia/filter_fascicles.PNG)

Below you can see examples of the results with and without fascicle filtering:

![filter fascicles 2](md_graphics/aia/filter_fascicles_2.PNG)

---

As the next step, specify the path to the **flip_flag.txt** file:

- Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**Flip Flags**</span> button.
- Select the <span style="color: #f97e25;">**flip_flag.txt**</span> file, located in the `DL_Track_US_example/images` folder.
- Ensure that the number of flip flags matches the number of images.

## 4. Adjusting Settings

As a last step before starting the analysis, you need to adjust the settings used by the aponeurosis and fascicle neural networks.

- Click the <span style="color: #a34ba1;">**settings wheel**</span> button in the GUI.  
This will open the `settings.py` file in your default text editor.

- The `settings.txt` file contains a dictionary of all relevant analysis parameters.
- Default values are listed, and each parameter is explained at the top of the file.

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Adapt these parameters according to your images or videos!  
> Correct parameter settings can greatly impact your analysis results.
>
> For future analyses, always test parameter settings on a small sample of your data first.
> *Especially, choose a pennation angle range that is physiologically plausible with a minimum range.*
> 
> If you accidentally disrupt the `settings.txt` file, there is a backup available: `_backup_settings.py` (only when downloading the repository).

üéâ **Congratulations! You have now completed the DL_Track_US tutorial for automated image analysis!**

Before finishing, it is important to review the error handling procedures in case something unexpected occurs.

## 6. Error Handling

During analysis, DL_Track_US has robust error handling to ensure you can identify and correct problems easily.

Whenever an error occurs:

- A <span style="color: #299ed9;">**message box**</span> will open inside the GUI.
- It will explain what went wrong and suggest how to fix it.

Example of an error message:

![error](md_graphics/aia/error.PNG)

---

We have tried to make all error messages as **concise** and **informative** as possible.  
Simply follow the instructions in the error box and restart the analysis after resolving the issue.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> If an unexpected error occurs that is not caught by a message box,  
> please report it in the [DL_Track_US Discussion Forum - Q&A Section](https://github.com/PaulRitsche/DLTrack/discussions/categories/q-a).

When reporting an issue:

- Please include a description of the problem,
- Steps to reproduce the issue,
- And (if possible) screenshots of the GUI and error message.
