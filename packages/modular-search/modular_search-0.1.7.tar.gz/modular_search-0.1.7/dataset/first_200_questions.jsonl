It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>\n\n<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>\n\n<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>\n\n<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>\n<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>\n<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>\n<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>\n<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>\n<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>\n<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>\n\n<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>\n\n<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source code to the above algorithm</a></p>\n\n<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems.

It also has a dependency on the <a href=\"https://libevent.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">libevent</a> for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting \"compile\" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is working on getting this off the ground?

Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>\n\n<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't \"trust\" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide \"Enterprise Level\" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down.

But when using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also \"leaks\" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>\n\n<p>Would a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid\" rel=\"noreferrer\">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of \"security through obscurity\" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>\n\n<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: for those who asked about just using the user name in the URL (e.g., <a href=\"http://example.com/user/yukondude\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://example.com/user/yukondude</a>), that works fine for object instances with names that are unique, but what about the zillions of web app objects that can really only be identified by number?

Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>\n\n<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>\n\n<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs \"release candidates.\" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>\n\n<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>\n\n<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is \"base\" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>\n\n<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tarantino/wiki/DatabaseChangeManagement\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page</a> to be very helpful. Especially this <a href=\"http://tarantino.googlecode.com/svn/docs/Database-Change-Management.ppt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt)</a></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of <code>*.sql</code> scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest).</p>\n"}

It extends C#\nand Visual Basic with native language\nsyntax for queries and provides class\nlibraries to take advantage of these\ncapabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax.</p>\n<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>\n<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588\">Andrei</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linq to Dataset</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>\n<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>\n<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>\n<li>Ability to debug queries</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>So what can I do with LINQ?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/489/ch00k\">Chook</a> provides a way to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432/csv-string-handling#4441\">output CSV files</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1/jeff-atwood\">Jeff</a> shows how to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9673/remove-duplicates-from-array#9685\">remove duplicates from an array</a><br />\nBob gets a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59/how-do-i-get-a-distinct-ordered-list-of-names-from-a-datatable-using-linq#62\">distinct ordered list from a datatable</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1659/marxidad\">Marxidad</a> shows how to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15486/sorting-an-ilist-in-c#15495\">sort an array</a><br />\nDana gets help implementing a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/185072/learning-linq-quicksort\">Quick Sort Using Linq</a></p>\n<h2>Where to start?</h2>\n<p><strong>A summary of links from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq\">GateKiller's question</a> are below</strong>:<br />\nScott Guthrie provides an <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">intro to Linq on his blog</a><br />\nAn overview of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LINQ on MSDN</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758/ChrisAnnODell\">ChrisAnnODell</a> suggests checking out:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hookedonlinq.com/MainPage.ashx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hooked on Linq</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">101 Linq Samples</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.linqpad.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LinqPad</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>\n<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits.
