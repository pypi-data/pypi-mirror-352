## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Install via PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install mag package directly from PyPI
pip install mcp-agent-graph

# View examples
# Clone the repository to get example code
git clone https://github.com/keta1930/mcp-agent-graph.git
cd mcp-agent-graph/sdk_demo
```

> **Update**: Starting from version v1.3.1, we officially released the Python SDK. You can now install and use it directly via pip.

> **Tip**: We provide usage examples in the sdk_demo directory.

### Option 2: Using Conda

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n mag python=3.11
conda activate mag

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/keta1930/mcp-agent-graph.git
cd mcp-agent-graph

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run main application
cd mag
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Using uv

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
Installation guide: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/keta1930/mcp-agent-graph.git
cd mcp-agent-graph

# Install dependencies
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 (powershell)
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat (cmd)

# Run directly with uv
cd mag
uv run python main.py
```

The backend server will run on port 9999, and the MCP client runs on port 8765.

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will run on port 5173.

### ‚ú® Core Features

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Graph-Based Agent Development Framework
Provides an intuitive visual environment that allows you to easily design and build complex intelligent agent systems.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Nodes as Agents
Each node in the graph is an independent intelligent agent that can leverage MCP server tool capabilities to complete specific tasks.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Nesting (Hierarchical Worlds)
Supports using entire graphs as nodes within other graphs, enabling hierarchical intelligent agent architectures and building "Agents within Agents."

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Graph to MCP Server
Export any graph as a standard MCP server Python script, making it callable as an independent tool by other systems.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Trading & Transfer
Package complete intelligent agent systems with all dependencies (configurations, prompts, documents) into self-contained, portable units that can be easily shared, transferred, and deployed across different environments. Automatic documentation generation creates comprehensive README files, enabling recipients to quickly understand your agent's capabilities and requirements. This feature provides solutions for agent marketplace trading, intra-organizational sharing, and cross-organizational sharing.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Rapid Agent Development
This project provides prompt template functionality for quickly generating prompt templates for developing intelligent agents. Templates help LLMs better understand this project and generate better nodes and graphs. The system automatically identifies registered models and MCP servers in the project and includes them in templates.
Implementation: Prompt template generation ‚Üí Requirements input ‚Üí LLM generates graph ‚Üí Import graph ‚Üí Run graph rapid development workflow.

<details>
<summary>üåê System Architecture</summary>

MAG follows a HOST-CLIENT-SERVER architecture:
- **HOST**: Central service that manages graph execution and coordinates communication between components
- **CLIENT**: MCP client that interacts with MCP servers
- **SERVER**: MCP servers that provide specialized tools and functionality

```
HOST  ‚Üí CLIENT  ‚Üí SERVER 
(Graph) ‚Üí (Agent) <==> (MCP Server)

## Development Details

For detailed development information, including a complete feature list, Agent configuration reference, intelligent agent node parameters, configuration examples, and advanced usage guides, please see the [Development Details Documentation](appendix/intro.md).

## üñºÔ∏è Frontend Feature Showcase

### Visual Agent Graph Editor

Visually create agent workflows by connecting nodes in a graph. Each node represents an agent with its own configuration, behavior, and capabilities.

### MCP Server Integration

Enhance your agent capabilities through MCP servers. Each agent node can leverage multiple MCP servers to access specialized capabilities such as web search, code execution, data analysis, etc.

### Nested Graphs (Graphs as Nodes)

Build hierarchical agent systems by using entire graphs as nodes within larger graphs. This creates modular, reusable agent components, enabling a "worlds within worlds" architecture.

### Graph to MCP Server Export

Export any graph as a standalone MCP server, making it usable as a tool for other agents or applications. This feature transforms your agent graphs into reusable services that can be composed into larger systems.
