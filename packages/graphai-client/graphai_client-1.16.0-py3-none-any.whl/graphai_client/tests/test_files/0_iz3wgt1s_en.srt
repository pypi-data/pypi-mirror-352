00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,500
Hello and welcome to this
thermodynamic moment.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,500
This lesson is devoted to simple systems.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,900
We will consider different
types of simple systems.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,460
First, a system that is rigid and closed.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,620
Second,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,740
a closed adiabatic mechanical system
and thirdly, a system that is closed.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,360
And for these different systems,
we will express the work and heat

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,320
according to the corresponding
state variables.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,020
So let's start with the
rigid and closed system.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,980
This system consists of a gas
that is homogeneous and is

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,040
in an enclosure whose walls
are immobile and says

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,140
in the long run, i.e. they let pass

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,340
the heat that we symbolize
here by this candle.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,000
So the thermal power PQ is not zero.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,740
The system is rigid, which
means that the mechanical power

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,320
of deformation PW is zero,
so its volume is constant.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,900
The amount of material that is

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,100
in this system is also constant
since the system is closed.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,780
So the only quantity that
varies is actually the entropy.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,660
So we will choose as extensive state
variable the entropy s of this system.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,020
the internal energy U and the
temperature T are state functions.

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,850
They will therefore be a function of

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,420
of the entropy S which is the
state variable of the system.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,800
We can calculate the derivative

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,820
time of the internal energy of the point
which is equal to the partial derivative

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
of the internal energy U compared to
the entropy S, which is by definition

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,900
the temperature T which
depends on other parts.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,460
Let be the time derivative
of the entropy S.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,340
This space.

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,740
By the first principle.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:16,220
We know that if PW is zero, then
the point reduces to a peak.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,140
Looking at this last identity,
namely that TS point is equal to PQ.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,200
We deduce that this point
is equal to PQ Safety.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,260
This means that there is only an
entropy exchange rate in this

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,890
equation, but that there is
no entropy production rate.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,140
Therefore,

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,400
the entropy production rate
Pi of S is zero, which means

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,940
that the processes that take place
on this rigid closed system,

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,500
which are heat exchange processes,
are reversible processes.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,610
We can now calculate the infinitesimal
heat that is supplied to the system.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,060
It is delta which by definition is equal
to the product of the thermal power.

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,660
PQ requires an infinitesimal
time interval.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
DT.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,180
Considering the first principle,

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,500
we see that PQ equals thirteen points,

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,640
which means that PQ DT
will be equal to T ds.

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,200
By integrating

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,900
this infinitesimal heat supplied to the
system, we obtain the heat supplied

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,940
to the system for a process that goes from
the initial state i to the final state f.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,820
It is q y f which is the
IIF integral of Delta q.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,580
We substitute the explicit form
of Delta ku as a function of

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,260
of the entropy S, that is to say tds that
we will integrate initial to final state.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,900
the state is characterized by the variable

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:56,320
of state, so we integrate from the initial
entropy s i to the final entropy scf.

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,460
The second system that
we will characterize,

56
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,140
it is the mechanical system
which is adiabatic, closed.

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,140
The system consists of a
homogeneous gas in a cylinder.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,460
And it is closed by two pistons.

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,020
The pistons are free to
slide symmetrically.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
This implies that the center of mass

61
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,380
of the system is immobile, so we do not
take into account its state of motion.

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,340
It is assumed that the
walls of the cylinder

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,140
are adiabatic walls and
that the pistons are also

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,500
adiabatic, which means that the
system is adiabatic closed.

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,140
Therefore, the thermal power PQ

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,540
is null and we will consider only
reversible processes on this system.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,220
By definition, if we have processes

68
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,020
reversible, the rate of
entropy production of Hess

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,860
is zero since the thermal
power PQ is zero.

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,580
And the entropy balance equation.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,660
We only get the time derivative

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,540
of the entropy at this point is zero,
which means that s is constant.

73
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,420
The system is closed,

74
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,580
therefore the quantity of matter
in this system is constant.

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,540
The only size that varies,

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,940
is the volume of the system
since we can move the pistons.

77
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,120
Therefore, the extensive state variable

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,620
that we will use to characterize
this system, it is the volume V.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,820
Internal energy and
pressure PS are functions

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,060
of the state, so they are
functions of the volume V.

81
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,340
We can now calculate the time
derivative of the internal energy Q.

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,100
This time derivative gives
us the following result.

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,960
This is the partial derivative

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,940
of the internal energy U with respect
to the volume v, which by definition is

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,580
equal to the pressure p which
depends on the volume V.

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,260
Times the derivative of the
volume V with respect to time cv.

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,620
Item.

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,060
The first principle tells us that
if the thermal power PQ is zero,

89
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,020
then it will be equal to the
mechanical power of deformation.

90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,120
PW.

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,700
So now we can.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,340
Obtain an explicit expression for
the infinitesimal work that is done.

93
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,540
On this system.

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,740
When we have a reversible process,

95
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:41,940
then the infinitesimal work is
Delta W which is defined as p w dt.

96
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,620
PW is equal to minus p v point.

97
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,220
So pw dt is me.

98
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,380
PW.

99
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
BV.

100
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,380
Using this expression of the
infinitesimal work done on the system,

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,220
we can find the work done from the
initial state to the final state.

102
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,380
F.

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
Simply to calculate the work done.

104
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,060
WF We integrate the infinitesimal work

105
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,180
delta w from the initial
state i to the final state.

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
F.

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,900
The variable is volume.

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,380
So we'll integrate.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,220
From initial volume to final volume VF.

110
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,660
POS, we add a six month.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,580
The third type of system that we will

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,300
consider, it is a simple, closed system.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,080
The system consists of a homogeneous gas

114
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,780
which is located in a cylinder
that is closed by two pistons.

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,480
It is similar to the previous system,
except that the walls of the cylinder

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,340
and the pistons are term walls,

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,580
so it lets heat through,
so there is heat exchange.

118
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,220
So PQ is non-zero.

119
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,940
The system is closed so there
is no exchange of matter.

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,520
To report on

121
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,300
of the variation of the volume
and the variation of entropy,

122
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,240
we will choose as extensive state
variables the entropy S and the volume V.

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,660
Internal energy,

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,100
temperature T and pressure
P are state functions.

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,980
They are therefore
functions of the variables

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,340
of state of this system which are
between parts and the volume p.

127
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,300
We can now determine the time
derivative of the internal energy.

128
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,700
Which consists of two terms.

129
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,280
The first term is the partial derivative

130
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,020
of Hull with respect to s which
corresponds to the temperature.

131
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,340
The second term,

132
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,000
is the partial derivative
of the internal energy U

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,460
compared to the volume V, which
corresponds to minus the pressure.

134
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,500
Faith. 20 point.

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,280
The first principle also states

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,620
that the time derivative of the
internal energy is equal to the sum.

137
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:17,620
The mechanical power of deformation
PW and the thermal power PQ.

138
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
We can now obtain an expression

139
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,940
explicit for the entropy production
rate which is defined for a system

140
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,360
adiabatic closed, ie when PQ is zero.

141
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,580
So we take the last previous identity.

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,960
And then we pass the second term

143
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,300
from the middle member into the right
member and divide it by the temperature.

144
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,460
For a closed adiabatic system is
this point is equal to Pi of s.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
Therefore, pi of s is equal to one

146
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
on the temperature which multiplies
the mechanical power of deformation pw

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,740
plus the product of the pressure p times
the rate of volume change v point.

148
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,740
All this is greater than or equal to zero.

149
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,220
We must now characterize the
mechanical power of deformation.

150
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,580
Which is due to the contact forces that
are exerted by the pistons on the gas.

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,620
So there are two terms.

152
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,740
The left term is due to the contact
force exerted by the left piston.

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:33,180
And the term on the right is due to the
contact force exerted by the right piston.

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,280
These terms add up and so in
the end, the mechanical power

155
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,980
will be equal to the scalar
product of the contact force.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,620
Times the speed. This
speed v is interpreted.

157
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,880
Like

158
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,280
the relative speed between
the pistons, i.e. the speed

159
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:58,480
of the left piston in the reference
frame of the right piston.

160
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,420
We can now introduce a vector R.

161
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,180
This vector r is the vector a.

162
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,260
This vector a is defined positive.

163
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,820
From the left to the right.

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,020
Its standard corresponds to the air.

165
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,580
From a piston.

166
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,120
We can express the strength of contacts

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,820
discounting based on
these discount vectors.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,420
This is the product.

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,820
From the external pressure, e.g.

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,180
One time.

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,020
And then the volume variation.

172
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,820
The rate of change of volume v point.

173
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,620
Is equal.

174
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,340
A me the scalar product of the
vector a with the velocity vector v.

175
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,860
Taking into account these two expressions,

176
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,140
we can now reformulate the mechanical
power of deformation in terms.

177
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,580
From the external pressure.

178
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,700
This mechanical power is
then expressed as follows.

179
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,020
PW is equal to me.

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,860
The external pressure for example.

181
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,600
The rate of change of volume V point.

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,440
We can now take this expression
of the mechanical power

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,060
and substitute it in the expression
of the entropy production rate.

184
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,580
We highlight v point which is
the rate of change of volume.

185
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,260
The entropy production rate
then takes the following form.

186
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,740
Pi ds is equal to one on the temperature,

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
which is a function of the entropy S and

188
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880
the volume V which
multiplies the difference

189
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,700
between the pressure of the system
which is a state function that depends

190
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,820
of S and V, minus the external pressure
which is not a state function.

191
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,380
And the whole is multiplied by the
rate of change of volume V weight.

192
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,180
The entropy production rate is
greater than or equal to zero.

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
We will now consider a process

194
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,660
reversible, i.e. by definition,
pi2 is zero if pi is zero.

195
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,760
The terms in brackets cancel each other
out, which implies that the pressure

196
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,980
which is a state function
that depends on the entropy S

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,900
and volume V, will be equal to
the external pressure e.g..

198
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,380
We can then re-express the power

199
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,780
mechanics of the information in terms
of the state variables of the system.

200
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,220
Thanks to this identity,

201
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,140
the mechanical deformation power
W is then expressed as minus.

202
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,940
The product of the pressure
which is a function of

203
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,100
of the entropy S of the volume V sees
the rate of change of volume V point.

204
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,300
It is also possible for
a reversible process.

205
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,440
Expressing the power

206
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,840
thermal PQ as a function of the
system state variables for a process

207
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,340
reversible is this weight is
equal to the ratio of PQ safety.

208
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,500
Therefore,

209
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,760
the thermal power PQ is equal to the

210
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,480
product of the temperature
which depends on

211
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,060
of the state variables
entropy S and volume V.

212
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,720
Is the time derivative
of entropy this point?

213
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,100
Using these definitions,

214
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,340
of the mechanical power of deformation
PWM and the thermal power PQ,

215
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,020
we can now establish explicit expressions

216
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,620
for the work done on
the system and the heat

217
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,740
provided to the system in terms
of the system state variables.

218
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,020
The infinitesimal work that is done.

219
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,400
Delta W

220
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,620
is equal to the product of the
mechanical deformation power PWM

221
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,260
for an infinitesimal time interval
DT, which is equal to minus p.

222
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,380
The pressure which is a function of
the entropy and the cold volume dv.

223
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
The infinitesimal heat that is provided

224
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,300
to the delta system q It is the
product of the thermal power PQ.

225
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,280
For an infinitesimal time interval

226
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,780
DT, which is equal to the product

227
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,500
of the temperature which is a function
of the entropy of the volume V times ds.

228
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,220
We can now integrate these two

229
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,400
expressions to obtain and
respectively the work done

230
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,800
of an initial state and a final state
f and the heat supplied to the system

231
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,460
from an initial state i a
final state f the work done.

232
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,940
W f.

233
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,380
It is the integral from the
initial state to the final state.

234
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,660
F Of infinitesimal work.

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,840
Delta W.

236
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,340
The state variable that
is varied is the volume.

237
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,180
We will have the integral on the volume.

238
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,360
The integral of the product, the pressure

239
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,780
which depends on the
entropy of the volume v.

240
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,380
Times dv. This is a volume integration,

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
so it is an integral that will be done

242
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,940
from the initial volume
28 to the final volume.

243
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,920
VF.

244
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,020
The heat supplied during the process from
the initial state to the final state.

245
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,300
F cooks.

246
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,300
It is the integral from the
initial state to the final state.

247
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,820
F of Delta.

248
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,440
Q.

249
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,900
It is thus an integral on entropy.

250
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,400
It is the integral of the initial entropy

251
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,200
and this at the input to
the final entropy s f

252
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,700
of the product of the temperature which is
a function of the entropy and the volume.

253
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Faith ds.
