00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello and welcome to make
fun of thermodynamics.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,460
This lesson is devoted to mechanical
equilibrium and mechanical transfers.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,720
To do this, we will consider an isolated
system that is made up of two sub-systems

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,660
simple systems that are separated by a
so-called moving and impermeable wall.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,020
In a first step, we will establish
the equilibrium condition

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,820
and in a second step, we will
examine the mechanical transfer.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,260
We therefore consider an isolated system.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,560
Which consists of two

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,860
simple sub-systems simple
sub-system one here

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,240
simple, two there, which are
separated by a wall said to term

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,340
mobile and impermeable since
the system is insulated.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,220
The thermal power PQ is the power

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,660
mechanical PW that are exerted
by the outside on the system.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,620
They suck?

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,020
To characterize the thermodynamics of this

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,570
system, two types of extensive
state variables are needed.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,180
First of all, entropy.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,380
Then the volume.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,850
For each simple subsystem,

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,020
we need an entropy variable
and a volume variable.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:30,140
The four state variables are
therefore an S2, V1 and V2.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,340
It is assumed that this system has already
reached the state of thermal equilibrium.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,660
When a system reaches
a thermal equilibrium,

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,570
this means that both subsystems
have the same temperature.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,140
Temperature is a state function,

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,620
it is therefore a function of the
state variables of each subsystem.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,490
Therefore, the thermal equilibrium
is written as follows.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,290
The temperature T of the first subsystem,

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,740
which is a function of S1 and becomes, is
equal to the temperature T of the second

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,060
sub-system, which is a
function of S2 and V2.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,700
Internal energy, temperature and
pressure are state functions.

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,660
They are therefore functions of the
state variables of each subsystem.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,020
The one point CT is one
point minus t1 v one point.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,220
The first principle tells us that the
cause of the time variation of one.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,660
It is.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,540
The thermal and mechanical powers
that are exerted by the second sub

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,820
system on the first subsystem,
namely PQ two one and PW two one.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,780
In a similar way two points.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
CT.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,260
Is it 2.01 p2? V.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,860
Two points.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,860
And the cause of the variation of the
internal energy of the second subsystem.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,000
According to the first principle,
it is the thermal power

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,880
and the mechanical power
exerted by the first subsystem

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:24,340
on the second subsystem, i.
e. PQ one two and PW one two.

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,420
the Internal Energy, it is a state
function, so the internal energy.

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,860
For the whole system, it
is a function of the set

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,140
of the state variables of the
system, i.e. it is a function of S1,

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,980
S2, V1 and V2, an
extensive state function.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,420
Thus the internal energy u of the system.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,580
And the sum of the internal
energy of this system.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,700
One of the internal energy
two. Of the subsystem.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,540
Two.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,540
We can now take the time
derivative of this relation.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,000
Eight points is one point plus two points.

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,180
According to the first principle.

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,780
There was a point.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,780
CPQ of one, pw of one and u two point.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,420
CPQ one two plus PW one two.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,700
Therefore, if the system is isolated,

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,740
the first principle tells
us that the point is zero.

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,220
So we get two identities.

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,380
First of all, there was a
point that equals less points.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,700
And then PQ one more pw one
two that is equal to me.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,860
PQ two one minus pw two one.

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
We must now take into account

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,020
explicitly of extensibility,
entropy and volume.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,380
Entropy is a state variable

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,560
extensive, so the entropy S of the system

70
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,060
is the sum of the entropy
S one of the first

71
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,020
and the entropy S two of
the second subsystem.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,900
Volume is also an
extensive state variable.

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,960
Therefore, the volume V of the
system is the sum of the volume V1

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,060
of the first subsystem and the
volume V2 of the second subsystem.

75
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,860
We can now take temporal derivatives
of these state variables.

76
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,140
First of all this point one
point plus is two points.

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,940
Then 20 points.

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,260
Which is equal had one
point higher two points.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,860
Finally, we explicitly take
into account the fact that

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,100
that the system is isolated
if the system is isolated.

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
According to the second principle

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,620
is this point is equal to Pi of
s which is positive or zero.

83
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,860
And if the system is isolated, the
volume of the system is constant,

84
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,660
so v points is zero, which implies that
v one point is equal to -22 points.

85
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,260
Therefore, if the volume
of a subsystem increases,

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,860
the volume of the other subsystem
will decrease and vice versa using

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,820
of the expression we established earlier
for eu one point and u of points.

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,780
We can now derive expressions
for s a point and s of points.

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,260
S 1.71 on the temperature that
multiplies U a point plus p1.

90
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,400
V a point and S 2.71 on T which multiplies

91
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,180
u two points plus p2 v two points.

92
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,540
We will now explicitly take into
account the fact that the system is

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,900
isolated, i.e. u of points is
equal to minus and one point.

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,060
And that V2 points is equal
to minus v1 one point.

95
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,580
This allows us to deduce
the explicit expression.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,720
The time derivative of entropy

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,900
of the system is the point which is
the sum of one point and s two points.

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,520
This is written as a surtout which

99
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,340
multiplies P1 minus p2
the however v a point.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,840
We now want to put this
equation back into shape

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,780
to make differentials appear explicitly.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,640
So we have multiplied by the
infinitesimal time interval dt

103
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,960
and we obtain in the left member
DS and in the right member

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,140
The last term is the differential

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,300
of the volume of the first
subsystem, i.e. rubber.

106
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,980
We can now take the derivative

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,760
partial entropy with respect to
the volume of the first subsystem

108
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,480
s on circles comes equal to
a safety that multiplies

109
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,180
the difference in
pressures, i.e. P1 and P2.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
The second principle

111
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,180
of thermodynamics, and more
precisely the condition

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,040
of the second principle,
states that entropy is maximum

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,020
at equilibrium, therefore at equilibrium,

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,820
the partial derivative of the entropy with
respect to the volume of the first sub

115
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,940
system, i.e. round s on round V1 and null.

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,920
Given the expression

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,700
which is on the first line,
i.e. circles on circles V1.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,100
A safety that multiplies P1 and minus P2.

119
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,780
Given this expression of the maximum

120
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,700
of entropy, we obtain the
equilibrium condition

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,120
mechanics, namely that
the terms in brackets

122
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,140
in the first expression must cancel
each other out, which implies.

123
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,460
Mechanical balance.

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,780
The pressure of the first subsystem P1

125
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,620
must be equal to the pressure
of the second subsystem P2.

126
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,940
Therefore, the first and second principles

127
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,320
requires that the pressures of the

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,480
subsystems and the same
value at equilibrium

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,420
before the system reaches the
state of mechanical equilibrium.

130
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,460
There is a mechanical transfer
between the two subsystems.

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,660
The mechanical balance is characterized by

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,340
by the equality of the pressures
of the two subsystems.

133
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,620
Therefore,

134
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,780
during the mechanical transfer, the
pressure P1 of the first subsystem is

135
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,140
different from the pressure
P2 of the second subsystem.

136
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,820
To examine these mechanical transfers,

137
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,580
we will base ourselves on the expression
of the temporal derivative of the entropy.

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,460
Is this the point?

139
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,240
It is a security that multiplies
p1 month, P2 times, v a point.

140
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,920
P1 is different from P2.

141
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,480
Moreover, since there is
a mechanical transfer.

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,100
The volume v1 of the first
subsystem will vary.

143
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,260
Therefore it is non-zero,
which implies that.

144
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,340
Is this point and not zero?

145
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,860
Moreover, we have a
system that is isolated.

146
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,300
For an isolated system.

147
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,860
This point is equal to the
entropy production rate Pi of S.

148
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,580
Since this point is non-zero
and is equal to Pi of S.

149
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
It must therefore be positive,

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,340
which means that we are dealing
with an irreversible process.

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
The explicit expression of the rate

152
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,660
of entropy production is
therefore the following.

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,300
Then of s, it is on the temperature
that multiplies P1 and P2.

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,700
That is, a 20-point drop, is positive.

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,260
We must now distinguish two cases.

156
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,740
In the first case, we consider
that the pressure B1 of the first

157
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,100
is higher than the pressure
P2 of the second subsystem.

158
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,740
This implies that the difference.

159
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,260
Of the two terms in
parentheses here is positive.

160
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,780
Therefore, for pi of s to be

161
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,580
positive, 20 one points
must also be positive.

162
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
The power

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,620
The mechanical force exerted by the first
subsystem ensures the second subsystem.

164
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,820
PW two is defined as less.

165
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,540
P1 v2 point.

166
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,340
It is also known that V of point is

167
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:24,260
equal to V a point, so p w a two
cp1 v a point that is positive.

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,720
Therefore, if the pressure

169
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,180
of the first subsystem is higher than
the pressure P2 of the second subsystem,

170
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,540
there is a work which is carried out
by the first sub-system on the second

171
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,140
under system, i.e. the wall
will move to the right.

172
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,420
Second scenario.

173
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,460
P2 is greater than P1.

174
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,900
In this case, the difference of the two
terms that appear in the expression

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,340
of the entropy production
rate is negative.

176
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,100
For copy of S is positive definite,

177
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,260
then 21 points must also be negative.

178
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,720
Mechanical power

179
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,020
exerted by the subsystem of its
subsystem one PW two is defined as P2.

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,100
V. One point.

181
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,420
It is therefore positive.

182
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,860
Therefore, if the P2 pressure of the sub

183
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,340
system two is higher than the
pressure P1 of subsystem one.

184
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,140
Subsystem two will perform
work on subsystem one.

185
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,980
This work.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,380
Will correspond to a shift
of the wall to the left.

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,260
Therefore.

188
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,660
During a mechanical transfer.

189
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,020
The work is done by the sub

190
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,620
system with the highest pressure.

191
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,620
Rated B+ on the sub-system
with the lowest pressure,

192
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,260
noted P months, this mechanical
transfer is a process

193
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,620
irreversible, i.e. pi of s is positive.

194
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,180
And this mechanical
transfer goes on gradually.

195
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,520
Bring the system to a state
of mechanical equilibrium

196
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,800
P1 is equal to P2, i.e. the
mechanical transfer is zero.
