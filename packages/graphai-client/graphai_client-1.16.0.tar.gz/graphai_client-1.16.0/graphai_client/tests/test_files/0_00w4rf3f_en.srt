1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:04,586
Bonjour.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,271
In this module, we will focus on

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,714
to control the position of the electric drive.

4
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,880
We were previously interested in the speed control of this system.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,329
For this, we will use the method

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,671
of Ziegler-Nichols to synthesize the regulator.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,371
We will see how to calculate the different parameters.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,357
We will also look at the rule of two

9
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,857
which allows you to make

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,114
a regulator calculated by Ziegler-Nichols that is less aggressive.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,414
Finally, we are going to do some exercises

12
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:32,286
to validate the regulators that we have synthesized

13
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:34,040
by the Ziegler-Nichols method.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,271
In this module, we will use

15
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:39,186
the same electric drive as in the previous modules.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,422
However, instead of measuring the angular velocity of the mass,

17
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:44,900
we will focus on the position of the disk.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,886
We will always apply a voltage U to the system

19
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,386
and this time we will measure the position of the disk

20
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,471
through a sensor.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
The measurement is the angle θ that we see here,

22
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,386
therefore the output yθ.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,486
This output is expressed in volts, between plus or minus 5 volts

24
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:05,429
and as the system runs infinitely, the voltage will rise,

25
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:11,799
go up then when it reaches for example 359 degrees,

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,886
it will return to zero and then go back up and so on.

27
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,057
Another dash here.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
The transfer function of our open loop system is very similar

29
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:34,286
to the one we had for the speed system.

30
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,880
Only we see here

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,920
an integrator term which is due to the measurement of the position.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,529
We also see here that we have the static gain

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,486
like before.

34
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,757
The gain is the gain seen by the position sensor

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,457
and the greater the gain seen by the speed sensor.

36
00:01:53,458 --> 00:02:00,114
So the static gain that we had previously is not at all equal

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,586
to the static gain we have for the position.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,143
On the other hand, the time constant,

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,000
it is similar to the one we had previously.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,297
Intuitively,

41
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:13,513
we feel that the time constant of the system should

42
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,386
look like the one we have previously.

43
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:15,943
Nothing changes.

44
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,428
On the other hand, the measurement

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,557
that we do through two different sensors implies

46
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,043
that the static gain is different.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,486
The regulator synthesis method that we will see today

48
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:28,900
is the first Ziegler-Nichols method.

49
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:32,786
It is a method that was defined in the 1940s.

50
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,786
This figure represents a typical response to a unit jump for a system

51
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:40,880
which was synthesized using Ziegler-Nichols.

52
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:44,120
This method is relatively simple and easy to implement.

53
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:47,186
Just apply an open loop jump to the system

54
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:51,571
to be able to find the information necessary for the design of the PID regulator.

55
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,200
There is no a priori knowledge to have.

56
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,213
On the other hand, what we see is that the answer is

57
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:57,429
relatively aggressive.

58
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,600
There is an over shoot which can be harmful in certain cases.

59
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:05,200
Just imagine that you are going to control the axis of a machine tool

60
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,586
and if you have an overshoot like that, you're going to bite into the material.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
In a few weeks we will see how to reduce

62
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,257
the aggressiveness of the regulator designed by Ziegler-Nichols.

63
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:20,729
The first Ziegler-Nichols method works as follows.

64
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:25,771
Here you have the answer of a system either with an integrator,

65
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,600
either without an integrator

66
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,529
and we will focus on a few key parameters.

67
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,586
The first parameter that interests us is the slope of this curve here.

68
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:37,614
We see that here we have our inflection point I

69
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:41,957
and the slope of our curve here which we define as a.

70
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:45,113
There is also the other point that interests us,

71
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,471
it is this value L,

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,214
this is when the line intersects the time axis.

73
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:58,457
We also have here the value minus a times L.

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,257
Once we have identified these values ​​a and L,

75
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:06,243
we can, using a table provided by Ziegler-Nichols,

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,800
calculate the parameters of the different P, PI or PID regulators.

77
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:16,143
Here you have the table for the first Ziegler–Nichols method

78
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:18,586
by entering your different values ​​a and L

79
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,629
and depending on the regulator you find,

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,629
you can find the values ​​of the different parameters Kp, Ti or Td.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,129
In practice, it is rarely a unit jump

82
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,829
that you have applied to your system.

83
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,414
So you need to take that into account and divide a to account for

84
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,300
of the amplitude of the signal that is applied.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,286
In this first experiment,

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,400
we will synthesize into a regulator using the Ziegler-Nichols method.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,314
To do this, we will first do an open loop measurement.

88
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,086
by measuring the position response of the system.

89
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,086
We will apply a jump in the linear zone

90
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:57,357
between about zero-seven and two volts and we're going to record the result.

91
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,614
Next, we will use the tool

92
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,700
temporal filter.

93
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:04,469
We will select the model that corresponds to the one we have

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,986
and we will adjust the values ​​of a and L.

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,200
Once we find these two parameters a and L,

96
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,971
we will look in the Ziegler-Nichols table which corresponds

97
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:16,514
to the first method to find the gains of a PID regulator.

98
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,257
The goal of this experiment is to continue a ramp without drag.

99
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:23,800
We will use the previous PID regulator.

100
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,914
We are going to apply a ramp between

101
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,886
plus or minus one volt with a frequency of 0.05 hertz

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,171
and you will observe the response.

103
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,759
Does your system correctly follow the ramp that is injected?

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,814
Secondly, you will deactivate the integrator term

105
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,600
and you will observe the response.

106
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,200
Normally a streak should appear.

107
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,571
In this third experiment, you will always use

108
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,686
the same PID regulator, but this time with a square wave,

109
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,243
always between zero and one volt.

110
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,543
And you will observe the response of the system

111
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:56,286
and more particularly the command that is applied to the system.

112
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,829
You will then deactivate the d term and the I term of the regulator

113
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,271
and you will observe the command again.

114
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,714
You will then answer the open questions

115
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,300
which are offered in this module.

116
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,843
Synthesis of a regulator using Ziegler-Nichols product

117
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,857
often a regulator that is very aggressive.

118
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,229
One method to make him less aggressive is the rule of two.

119
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:21,386
It is an empirical rule that divides the gain Kp by two

120
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,043
and which multiplies Ti and Td by two.

121
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:27,700
Here we see the first system with a Ziegler-Nichols response.

122
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:31,457
We see that we have a fairly steep slope, strong overruns,

123
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,614
but on the other hand, time here is quite fast.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,586
Here we see the response of the same system, but this time,

125
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:41,600
we applied the rule of two to the different gains of the PID regulator

126
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,757
and we see that here the establishment time is much greater

127
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,057
by the amplitude here is much lower than that which we had here.

128
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:53,043
Our regulator is less aggressive, but it is also slower.

129
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,400
In this fourth experiment, we will implement the rule of two.

130
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,314
For this, we will use the regulator

131
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:03,300
which we calculated previously using Ziegler-Nichols.

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,957
We will always apply a square signal between -1 and 1 volt

133
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,071
with a frequency of 0.02 hertz.

134
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:10,143
We will look at the answer.

135
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:13,171
Then, we will apply the rule of two

136
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:17,471
and modify the parameters of the PID regulator, Kp,

137
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:21,343
we're going to divide it by two and we're going to multiply Ti Td by two.

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,200
You will then observe the response to be able to respond

139
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,886
to the green questions of the current module.

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
In this last experiment, we will see how a PID regulator

141
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:34,571
for the system in position can reject a constant disturbance.

142
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,280
This constant disturbance,

143
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,171
we will simulate it using an a priori command that we apply to the system.

144
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:44,514
We saw that the term I made it possible to compensate for the friction of the engine,

145
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:48,871
but we will see which also allows us to reject a constant disturbance.

146
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,600
For this, we will take the PID regulator

147
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,300
that we calculated previously,

148
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,814
we will apply a constant signal of 1 volt,

149
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,929
then, we will change the a priori order U0

150
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,300
going from 0 to 2 volts.

151
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,186
Then you will turn off the PID term and observe the effect on the response.

152
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,743
You can then respond

153
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:09,640
to the various open questions relating to this experience.

154
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,743
Today we saw that the system in position

155
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,786
to an integrator who is already present.

156
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,160
We also saw the Ziegler-Nichols synthesis method

157
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,520
which defines a regulator that is relatively aggressive.

158
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,270
We have seen the method of both

159
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:27,186
which makes it possible to reduce the “aggressiveness” of this regulator.

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,943
We have also seen that the integrator term allows us to overcome friction

161
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:35,000
and also to reject constant disturbance.
