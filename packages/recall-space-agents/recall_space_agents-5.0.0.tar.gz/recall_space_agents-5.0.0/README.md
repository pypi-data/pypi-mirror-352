# üîÖIntroduction

The **Recall Space Agents** package leverages Langraph, Langchain, and 
the Agent Builder package to provide standard tools for agentic applications 
and high-level abstractions. This allows complex workflows to be expressed 
with just a few lines of code when the tasks are known and common.

If the workflows are not common or require special implementation, you can 
use Langraph and Langchain directly and then integrate them. The following 
are the main modules of this package:

+ **Hierarchical Applications:** In complex systems, it's often necessary to 
decompose tasks into smaller, manageable units. This hierarchical agents abstraction 
allows you to create a `Supervisor` that manages multiple `Worker` agents. 
The supervisor delegates tasks to workers and coordinates their execution to 
fulfill user requests. The system comprises three main components:
    + `Worker`: An abstract base class representing individual worker agents.
    + `Supervisor`: Manages workers and routes tasks to them. 
    + `ApplicationGraph`: Builds and manages the execution graph comprising 
    the supervisor and workers.

üÖ∞Ô∏è The `Supervisor` has the ability to generate execution plans for complex tasks.
Internally, the `Supervisor` acts as a human proxy, commanding AI `Workers`.
Technically, this means that the `Supervisor` adds `Human` messages to the
conversation, while the `Workers` add `AI` messages. Only the `Supervisor`
knows about the overall plan and has access to the full context of the conversation.
The `Workers` receive a single command from the `Supervisor` each time and are
not aware of the conversation history.

‚úîÔ∏èPlease visit the example of [Open Purchase Orders](examples.md), to see Supervisor
with the plan flag activated.

+ **Realized Workers**: These are agents whose only tools are Recall Space Toolkits. 
This means their entire job is to fulfill tasks that are related to their attached toolkits.

+ **Toolkits**: These are functions with special metadata that allow LLMs to 
determine whether a function call is required to complete a task and what the 
parameters should be. `Toolkits` are collections of `Tools` organized based on the underlying client.

  As of today, 12-27-2024, the only underlying client is the Microsoft Graph API Python 
  SDK, organized by resource. For example, there is a `Toolkit` called `MSTodoToolKit`, 
  which contains `Tools` related to the Microsoft To Do app, connected via the 
  Microsoft Graph API. We plan to maintain this pattern as more `Toolkits` are 
  developed, continuing to build increasingly complex applications.

# üöÄExample: VIPUserApp.
+ *Example of a Complex Composed Double Hierarchical Applications*.

This hypothetical workflow represents a paid and free app for VIP users. 
Imagine that we, at Recall Space, have preferential access to Supplier Data, 
and that Lisa AI receives emails from general users inquiring about suppliers.

We are interested in some key users whom we have identified. These key users 
fall into two categories:

1. VIP Users Already Onboarded:
    + We want to provide them with daily updates about our best suppliers, 
    reinforcing our relationship and offering them exclusive value.
    + We want to create a TODO task to give special attention to their emails.
2. VIP Users Not Yet Onboarded but Who Have Emailed Us:
    + We aim to make them feel special by having Lisa AI reply with an 
    invitation to join, encouraging them to become onboarded users.

As a company with preferential access to suppliers, it is crucial for us to 
ensure that our VIP users receive timely and relevant information about our best 
suppliers. This strategy not only strengthens our relationships with these key 
clients but also leverages our unique position in the market.

Overall, the 'VIPUserApp' workflow enhances user engagement, promotes our unique 
offerings, and strengthens relationships with key clients‚Äîall while efficiently 
managing interactions based on each user's subscription status.

# ‚ùï Key Notes on VIPUserApp

- **Logical Flow vs. Graph Structure**: The logical flow of the application differs from its graph representation.

- **Supervisor and Workers Abstraction**:
  - This abstraction is primarily used to enable Lisa AI to compose more complex applications with a reduced chance of failure.
  - It requires fewer tokens to generate, which naturally decreases the probability of errors or failures during generation.

- **Spectrum of Control in Workflow Design**:
  - You can exert varying levels of control over the workflow, but increased control often adds structural complexity.
    - **Using the Supervisor and Workers Abstraction**:
      - Simplifies the structural complexity of the workflow.
      - Introduces some uncertainty in execution due to higher-level abstraction.
    - **Using Raw Functions Under Node**:
      - Provides full control over the workflow.
      - Increases the structural complexity due to low-level configuration.

## License
Open source. See LICENSE for details.

## Usage Examples

### Token Management and Email Sending
Here's an example of how to use the MSGraphTokenToolkit to get access tokens and use them with other toolkits:

```python
from recall_space_agents.toolkits.ms_graph_token.ms_graph_token_toolkit import MsGraphTokenToolkit
from recall_space_agents.toolkits.ms_email.ms_email import MSEmailToolKit
from recall_space_agents.utils.raw_token_credential import RawTokenCredential

# Initialize MSGraphTokenToolkit
toolkit = MsGraphTokenToolkit(
    keyvault_url="https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    redirect_uri="your-redirect-uri",
    scope=[
        "Mail.Read",
        "Mail.ReadWrite",
        "Mail.Send",
        "People.Read",
        "Contacts.Read",
        "Contacts.ReadWrite",
    ]
)

# Generate a consent link for a user
consent_link = await toolkit.agenerate_link_for_consent(email="user@example.com")

# Once user has given consent, generate an access token
access_token = await toolkit.agenerate_new_access_token(email="user@example.com")

# Use the access token with MSEmailToolKit
email_toolkit = MSEmailToolKit(credentials=RawTokenCredential(access_token))

# Send an email
response = await email_toolkit.asend_email(
    subject="Test Email",
    body_html="<h1>Hello World</h1>",
    to_recipient="recipient@example.com"
)

# Read unread emails
emails = await email_toolkit.aget_emails(
    limit=2,
    skip=0,
    filter="isRead eq false"
)
```

### Using with Agent-Based Architecture
For more complex workflows, you can use the agent-based architecture:

```python
from recall_space_agents.hierarchical_agents.realized_workers.ms_graph_token_manager import MsGraphTokenManager
from recall_space_agents.hierarchical_agents.application_graph import ApplicationGraph
from recall_space_agents.hierarchical_agents.supervisor import Supervisor

# Initialize token manager with LLM
token_manager = MsGraphTokenManager(
    llm=your_llm,
    keyvault_url="your-keyvault-url",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    redirect_uri="your-redirect-uri",
    scope=["Mail.Send", "Contacts.ReadWrite"]
)

# Set up supervisor with workers
workers = [token_manager]
supervisor = Supervisor(llm=your_llm, workers=workers)

# Create application graph
app = ApplicationGraph(supervisor).get_compiled_graph()

# Run the application
state = {
    "messages": [("user",
    """
    Please check if the user with email user@example.com has consented to Mail.Send scope,
    if no, please give me the consent link to send the consent request.
    """)]
}

async for response in app.astream(state, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(str(response))
```
