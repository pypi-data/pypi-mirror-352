### 1. AI-Powered Context Awareness UI/UX Automation for Adaptive XR Interfaces
*Pages 1-15*

This research focuses on developing AI-powered UI/UX automation components to create adaptive XR interfaces that can intelligently respond to the user’s environment. The goal is to overcome limitations of current 2D UI/UX design, which struggles with rapid hardware and OS advancements. Specifically, the project aims to optimize AI-based context awareness for XR by focusing on key elements like LOD (Level of Detail), Frame Stability, and Anti-aliasing – all crucial for creating immersive experiences.  A pilot study will be conducted within May 2025, utilizing a tank driving simulation as a demonstration platform, particularly with the Tank Arena game.
