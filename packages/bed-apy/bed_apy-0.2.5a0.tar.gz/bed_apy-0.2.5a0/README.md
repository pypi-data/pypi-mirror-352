# Bed_APY  
### The WebSocket-powered bridge between Python & Minecraft Bedrock  

## ðŸš€ About This Project

## âœ¨ Story of This Project  
_Originally a small experiment, Bed_APY evolved into a powerful Minecraft scripting bridge that lets Python interact with Bedrock Edition using WebSocketsâ€”unlocking endless automation and creative possibilities._  
## The Story of the Name  
When I first started working on this, I called it **mc_api**â€”clear, right? Nope! When importing, I accidentally downloaded a **random Brazilian mc_api**, which caused a bit of a headache.  
Despite the confusion, mc_api stuckâ€”until publishing, when I decided to rename it for easier installation.  

I first thought of **bed_api**, but it felt too generic. Then I tried **bed_pi** (Python + API = Pi), but that still seemed off. Finally, I landed on **bed_apy**:  
- **Bed = Bedrock** (easy!)  
- **APY = API + PYthon** (perfect!)  

And just like that, the name was **locked in!** ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
