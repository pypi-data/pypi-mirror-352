    GPU implementation of in-place rotation of coordinates.

    This function is not implemented yet and will be added when the full GPU implementation is ready.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    rot : np.ndarray
        3x3 rotation matrix
    b : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (3, n) containing coordinates to rotate

    # Future implementation will include:
    # 1. Transfer data to GPU memory
    # 2. Run a GPU kernel to perform the rotation
    # 3. Transfer results back to CPU memory if needed
    
    # Example implementation might look like:
    # import cupy as cp
    # rot_gpu = cp.asarray(rot)
    # b_gpu = cp.asarray(b)
    # result_gpu = cp.matmul(rot_gpu, b_gpu)
