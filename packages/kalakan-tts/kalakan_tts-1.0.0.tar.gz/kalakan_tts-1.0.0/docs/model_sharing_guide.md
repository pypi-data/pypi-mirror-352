## Why Share Your Models

Sharing your trained Twi TTS models offers several benefits:

- **Expand Access**: Help make Twi TTS technology more widely available
- **Enable Innovation**: Allow others to build applications without training costs
- **Improve Quality**: Community feedback helps identify and fix issues
- **Recognition**: Gain recognition for your contribution to Twi language technology
- **Collaboration**: Connect with others working on similar problems
- **Research Advancement**: Support academic and industrial research in African languages

## Preparing Your Models for Sharing

### 1. Export Your Models

Export your models in a portable format:

```bash
kalakan-export \
    --acoustic-model models/my_tacotron2_twi/best_model.pt \
    --vocoder models/my_hifigan_twi/best_model.pt \
    --output-dir shared_models/twi_tts_v1.0 \
    --format pytorch \
    --include-config \
    --include-samples
```

This will create a directory with:
- Acoustic model file
- Vocoder model file
- Configuration files
- Sample audio files
- Metadata

### 2. Optimize for Sharing

Consider creating different versions:

- **Full Model**: Complete model with highest quality
- **Quantized Model**: Smaller size with slight quality reduction
- **Small Model**: Lightweight version for mobile/edge devices

```bash
# Create quantized version
kalakan-export \
    --acoustic-model models/my_tacotron2_twi/best_model.pt \
    --vocoder models/my_hifigan_twi/best_model.pt \
    --output-dir shared_models/twi_tts_v1.0_quantized \
    --format pytorch \
    --quantize \
    --include-config
```

### 3. Include Necessary Files

Ensure your shared package includes:

- Model files (`.pt`, `.onnx`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`)
- Phoneme dictionary
- README with basic usage instructions
- LICENSE file
- Sample audio files
- Metadata about training

## Creating a Model Card

A model card provides essential information about your model. Create a `MODEL_CARD.md` file with:

### Basic Information

```markdown
# Twi TTS Model v1.0

A text-to-speech model for the Twi language trained using the Kalakan TTS framework.

## Model Details

- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Developer**: [Your Name/Organization]
- **Contact**: [Your Email/Contact Information]

## Model Description

This model converts Twi text to natural-sounding speech. It uses a Tacotron2 architecture for text-to-mel conversion and a HiFi-GAN vocoder for mel-to-audio conversion.

### Intended Use

- The model performs best with standard Twi orthography
- Performance may vary with dialectal variations
- The model may struggle with code-switching between Twi and other languages
- Not optimized for real-time inference on low-power devices

### Usage Examples

```markdown
## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from kalakan_twi_tts import TwiSynthesizer

# Initialize with the shared models
synthesizer = TwiSynthesizer(
    acoustic_model="path/to/acoustic_model.pt",
    vocoder="path/to/vocoder.pt"
)

# Generate speech
audio = synthesizer.synthesize("Akwaaba! Wo ho te sɛn?")
synthesizer.save_audio(audio, "output.wav")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Customize speech parameters
audio = synthesizer.synthesize(
    text="Akwaaba! Wo ho te sɛn?",
    speed=1.2,  # 20% faster
    pitch=1.1,  # Slightly higher pitch
    energy=1.0  # Normal volume
)
```
```

### Ethical Considerations

```markdown
## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
- The training data does not contain personally identifiable information
- Voice samples were recorded with informed consent for TTS purposes

### Potential Misuse
- This model could potentially be used to generate misleading audio content
- Users should implement appropriate safeguards and disclosures

### Environmental Impact
- Training this model required approximately 120 GPU hours
- Consider using the quantized version for deployment to reduce carbon footprint

### Bias and Fairness
- The model was trained on Asante Twi and may not perform equally well for other dialects
- The training data represents a single speaker and may not generalize to all Twi speakers
```
