## System Overview

Kalakan TTS is a complete text-to-speech system specifically designed for the Twi language. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.

### High-Level Architecture

The system is divided into several key subsystems:

1. **Text Processing Subsystem**: Handles text normalization, cleaning, tokenization, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.
2. **Acoustic Modeling Subsystem**: Converts phoneme sequences to mel spectrograms using neural network models.
3. **Vocoder Subsystem**: Converts mel spectrograms to audio waveforms using neural network models.
4. **Training Subsystem**: Provides infrastructure for training and fine-tuning models.
5. **Inference Subsystem**: Orchestrates the text-to-speech process for efficient inference.
6. **API Subsystem**: Exposes the system's functionality through various interfaces.

### Architecture Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies.
2. **Extensibility**: New models and features can be added without modifying existing code.
3. **Configurability**: System behavior can be customized through configuration files.
4. **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable in isolation.
5. **Performance**: Critical paths are optimized for efficient inference.

## Core Components

### Text Processing

The text processing subsystem is responsible for converting raw text input into a format suitable for the acoustic model.

#### Key Components

1. **Normalizer (`kalakan.text.normalizer`)**: Converts text to a canonical form by expanding abbreviations, converting numbers to words, etc.
2. **Cleaner (`kalakan.text.cleaner`)**: Removes unnecessary characters, fixes common errors, etc.
3. **Tokenizer (`kalakan.text.tokenizer`)**: Splits text into tokens (words, punctuation, etc.).
4. **G2P Converter (`kalakan.text.twi_g2p`)**: Converts graphemes (text) to phonemes (sound units).
5. **Enhanced G2P (`kalakan.text.enhanced_g2p`)**: Extends the basic G2P with additional features for handling complex Twi text.

#### Design Considerations

## Design Patterns

The Kalakan TTS system employs several design patterns to ensure a clean, maintainable, and extensible architecture:

### Factory Pattern

The `ModelFactory` class in `kalakan.utils.model_factory` implements the Factory pattern to create acoustic models and vocoders based on configuration parameters. This allows for dynamic model creation without exposing the instantiation logic to the client code.

### Strategy Pattern

The acoustic models and vocoders implement the Strategy pattern, allowing different algorithms (models) to be selected at runtime. The `BaseAcousticModel` and `BaseVocoder` classes define the interface, and concrete implementations provide different strategies for generating mel spectrograms and audio waveforms.

### Adapter Pattern

The G2P converters implement the Adapter pattern to provide a consistent interface for different phoneme conversion strategies. This allows for easy switching between different G2P implementations.

### Observer Pattern

The training infrastructure implements the Observer pattern through callbacks, allowing various components to react to training events (e.g., logging, checkpointing, early stopping).

### Composite Pattern

The model architecture implements the Composite pattern, with complex models composed of simpler components (e.g., encoders, decoders, attention mechanisms).
