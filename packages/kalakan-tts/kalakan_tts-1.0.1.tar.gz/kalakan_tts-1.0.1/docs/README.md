## Documentation Conventions

Throughout the documentation, we use the following conventions:

- Code blocks are shown with syntax highlighting:
  ```python
  from kalakan.synthesis.synthesizer import Synthesizer

  synthesizer = Synthesizer()
  audio = synthesizer.synthesize("Akwaaba! Wo ho te sÉ›n?")
  ```

- Command line examples are prefixed with `$` for commands and show output without a prefix:
  ```bash
  $ kalakan-synthesize --text "Akwaaba!" --output output.wav
  Synthesizing speech...
  Speech saved to output.wav
  ```

- Notes and warnings are highlighted:
  > **Note:** This is an important note.

  > **Warning:** This is a warning about potential issues.
