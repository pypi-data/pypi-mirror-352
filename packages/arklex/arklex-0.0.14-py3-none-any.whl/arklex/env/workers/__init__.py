"""Worker implementations for the Arklex framework.

This module contains various worker implementations that handle different types of tasks
within the Arklex framework. Each worker is specialized for a specific functionality,
such as message generation, database operations, search, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) tasks. The workers are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for
flexible integration into the framework's workflow system.
