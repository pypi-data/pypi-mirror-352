# netcrypt

**Secure socket communication and tunneling for Python**

---

##  Overview
`netcrypt` is a Python library designed to simplify encrypted communication over networks. It supports AES and RSA encryption, secure tunnel setup, and socket communication for secure file transfers or messaging.

---

## Features
- AES & Fernet encryption for data-in-transit
- RSA key generation and usage for asymmetric encryption
- Encrypted TCP client-server sockets
- Command-line interface for tunnels and key management
- Optional tunnel threading support for background services

---

##  Installation
```bash
pip install netcrypt
```

---

## Usage
### Generate AES Key:
```bash
netcrypt keygen --generate --keyfile aes.key
```

### Start Secure Tunnel:
#### Server
```bash
netcrypt tunnel --mode server --keyfile aes.key --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```
#### Client
```bash
netcrypt tunnel --mode client --keyfile aes.key --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

### Generate RSA Key Pair:
```bash
netcrypt rsagen --out-private rsa_private.pem --out-public rsa_public.pem
```
