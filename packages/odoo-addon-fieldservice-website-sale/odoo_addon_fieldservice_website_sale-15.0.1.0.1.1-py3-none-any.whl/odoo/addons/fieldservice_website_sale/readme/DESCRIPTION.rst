This module integrates e-commerce with field service workflows, allowing customers to create sale orders through the e-commerce platform while selecting a preferred delivery date and time range. These selections are used to determine the delivery window for the associated stock picking and field service management (FSM) orders. When an FSM order is created, it is automatically assigned to the appropriate FSM day route based on the selected delivery date. This integration streamlines operations by automating the assignment of day routes from incoming sale orders, ensuring organized and efficient scheduling.
