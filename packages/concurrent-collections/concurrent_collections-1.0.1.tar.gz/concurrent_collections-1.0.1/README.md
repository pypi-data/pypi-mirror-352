# Python Concurrent (thread-safe) collections

Thread-safe Python collections: `ConcurrentBag`, `ConcurrentDictionary`, and `ConcurrentQueue`.

## tl;dr

Python's built-in `list`, `dict`, and `deque` are thread-safe for some operations, but not all. 

`concurrent_collections` provides thread-safe alternatives by using locks internally to ensure safe concurrent access and mutation from multiple threads.

## Why use these collections?

**_There is a lot of confusion on whether Python collections are thread-safe or not_**<sup>1, 2, 3</sup>.

The bottom line is that Python's built-in collections are **not fully thread-safe** for all operations. While some simple operations (like `list.append()` or `dict[key] = value`) are thread-safe due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), **compound operations and iteration with mutation are not**. This can lead to subtle bugs, race conditions, or even crashes in multi-threaded programs.

See the [Python FAQ: "What kinds of global value mutation are thread-safe?"](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/library.html#what-kinds-of-global-value-mutation-are-thread-safe) for details. The FAQ explains that only a handful of simple operations are guaranteed to be atomic and thread-safe. For anything more complex, you must use your own locking or a thread-safe collection.

I could not find any simple concurrent implementation, so `concurrent_collections` provides drop-in replacements that handle locking for you, making concurrent programming safer and easier.

## Installation

Pip:

```bash
pip install python-nameof
```

My recommendation is to always use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of pip – I personally think it's the best package and environment manager for Python.

```bash
uv add python-nameof
```

## Collections

### ConcurrentBag

A thread-safe, list-like collection.

```python
from concurrent_collections import ConcurrentBag

bag = ConcurrentBag([1, 2, 3])
bag.append(4)
print(list(bag))  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### ConcurrentDictionary

A thread-safe dictionary. For atomic compound updates, use `update_atomic`.

```python
from concurrent_collections import ConcurrentDictionary

d = ConcurrentDictionary({'x': 1})
d['y'] = 2  # Simple assignment is thread-safe
# For atomic updates:
d.update_atomic('x', lambda v: v + 1)
print(d['x'])  # 2
```

### ConcurrentQueue

A thread-safe double-ended queue.

```python
from concurrent_collections import ConcurrentQueue

q = ConcurrentQueue()
q.append(1)
q.appendleft(0)
print(q.pop())      # 1
print(q.popleft())  # 0
```
