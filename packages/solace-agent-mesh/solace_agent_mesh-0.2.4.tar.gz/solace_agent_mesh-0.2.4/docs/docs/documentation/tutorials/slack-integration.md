# Slack Integration

In this tutorial, you will integrate a Slack interface into Solace Agent Mesh, enabling interaction with the system directly from your Slack workspace and channels.

:::info[Learn about gateways]
We recommend you read about [Gateways](../concepts/gateways.md) before you start this tutorial.
:::

## Setting Up the Environment

First, you need to [install Solace Agent Mesh and Solace Mesh Agent (SAM) CLI](../getting-started/installation.md), and then you'll want to [create a new Solace Agent Mesh project](../getting-started/quick-start.md) or [create a new plugin](../concepts/plugins/create-plugin.md).

## Creating the Slack App

Next, create a [Slack Application](https://api.slack.com/apps) in your workspace.

1. Go to the [Slack Application](https://api.slack.com/apps) website.
2. Select **Your Apps** and click **Create New App**.
3. Choose **From a manifest** and apply the following configuration.
   - You can customize the name and description, but keep the rest of the configuration and settings unchanged.

```yaml
display_information:
  name: solace-agent-mesh-bot
  description: An app to integrate with Solace Agent Mesh
features:
  app_home:
    home_tab_enabled: false
    messages_tab_enabled: true
    messages_tab_read_only_enabled: false
  bot_user:
    display_name: Solace Agent Mesh
    always_online: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - bookmarks:read
      - channels:history
      - channels:join
      - channels:manage
      - channels:read
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.customize
      - chat:write.public
      - files:read
      - files:write
      - groups:history
      - groups:read
      - groups:write
      - im:history
      - im:read
      - im:write
      - links:read
      - links:write
      - mpim:history
      - mpim:read
      - mpim:write
      - pins:read
      - pins:write
      - reactions:read
      - reactions:write
      - reminders:read
      - reminders:write
      - team:read
      - usergroups:read
      - usergroups:write
      - users.profile:read
      - users:read.email
      - users:read
      - users:write
      - conversations.connect:read
      - conversations.connect:write
      - incoming-webhook
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.groups
      - message.im
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Then select `Create` and your new App will be created.

### App-Level Tokens

In your created App, select `Basic Information` under `Settings`. Scroll down to `App-Level Tokens` and click `Generate Token and Scopes`.

Provide your token a name, add all available scopes, and then click `Generate`.

Make note of the resulting application token (beginning with `xapp-`) - you will need it in a future step.

### Installing the App in Your Slack Workspace

Next, select **Install App** under **Settings** and follow the installation flow to install the App in your workspace.

After installation, the bot token (beginning with `xoxb-`) will be visible. Make note of this token.

## Installing the Slack Interface and Gateway

After configuring your Slack App, the next step is to add the Slack interface and gateway to Solace Agent Mesh.

1. Create the gateway and interface using the Solace Agent Mesh (SAM) CLI:

   ```sh
   sam add gateway slackbot --interface slack
   ```

   This command generates two configuration files:

   ```plain
   Created the following gateway template files:
     - ./configs/gateways/slackbot/gateway.yaml
     - ./configs/gateways/slackbot/slack.yaml
   ```

2. Configure the required environment variables:

   The Slack interface requires two authentication tokens. Add these to your `.env` file in the project root directory using the tokens generated during Slack App setup:

   ```env
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-xxxxxxxxxx
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-xxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   :::note

   While you can customize the gateway and interface behavior by modifying `gateway.yaml` and `slack.yaml`, this is optional.

   :::

## Running the Interface and Gateway

Launch the interface and gateway with:

```sh
sam run -b
```

For detailed information about available SAM CLI commands, see [Solace Agent Mesh CLI](../concepts/cli.md).

## Testing the Installation

To test your installation:

1. Open your Slack workspace in the desktop app or browser.
2. Find and click on the **Solace Agent Mesh** app under the **Apps** section.
3. Send a test message by typing `hello` and click **Enter**.
4. You should see:
   - A "Chatbot is thinking..." status message
   - A response from the chatbot within a few seconds
