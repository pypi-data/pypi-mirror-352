    Implements a generic rate limiting mechanism to control the frequency of operations
    or requests based on a specified key.

    This class tracks the number of requests made within a defined time window
    and prevents further requests if a maximum limit is exceeded. It is thread-safe,
    making it suitable for use in multi-threaded environments like web servers.
