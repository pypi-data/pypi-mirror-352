"""
This file serves as the initialization point for the 'lback_framework/lback/utils' package.
It is designed to expose a collection of various utility functions and helper classes
that are commonly used across different parts of the Lback web framework. This package
centralizes general-purpose functionalities that do not fit neatly into other specific
framework components, enhancing code reusability and simplifying common development tasks.

---

**Key Components Exposed by this Package:**

1.  **AdminUserManager (from .admin_user_manager):**
    A utility class specifically designed for managing administrative user accounts.
    This component provides helper methods for common operations related to admin users,
    such as creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting admin user records,
    potentially integrating with the AdminUserRepository.

2.  **AppSession (from .app_session):**
    A utility or class for managing application-specific session data. This might be
    a higher-level abstraction over the core session management, providing convenient
    methods for storing and retrieving data relevant to the current user's application session.

3.  **EmailSender (from .email_sender):**
    A utility class or function for sending emails from the application. This component
    abstracts away the complexities of configuring and interacting with email servers,
    providing a simple interface for sending various types of emails (e.g., password resets,
    notifications).

4.  **File Handlers (from .file_handlers):**
    A set of utility functions for handling file operations, particularly related to uploaded files.

    * **validate_uploaded_file:** A function to validate properties of an uploaded file,
        such as its size, type, or allowed extensions, before saving.
    * **save_uploaded_file:** A function to securely save an uploaded file to a specified
        location on the server's file system.
    * **delete_saved_file:** A function to remove a previously saved file from the server.

5.  **Filters (from .filters):**
    A collection of utility functions that can be used for filtering or transforming data.

    * **file_extension_filter:** A filter to process or validate file extensions.
    * **split_filter:** A filter to split strings based on a delimiter.
    * **date_filter:** A filter to format or parse date values.

6.  **Response Helpers (from .response_helpers):**
    Utility functions that simplify the creation of common HTTP responses.

    * **json_response:** A helper function to quickly create and return an HTTP response
        with JSON content, setting appropriate headers.

7.  **SessionManager (from .session_manager):**
    A utility class for lower-level management of user sessions. This component might
    handle the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of session data, interacting
    directly with the session storage mechanism.

8.  **Shortcuts (from .shortcuts):**
    A collection of convenience functions designed to simplify common tasks in views
    or other parts of the application, reducing boilerplate code.

    * **render:** A shortcut function to render an HTML template and return an HTMLResponse.
    * **redirect:** A shortcut function to create an HTTP redirect response.
    * **return_403:** A shortcut to return an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.
    * **return_404:** A shortcut to return an HTTP 404 Not Found response.
    * **return_500:** A shortcut to return an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response.
    * **_get_model_form_data:** A private or internal helper to extract form data related to a model.
    * **paginate_query:** A helper to paginate a database query result.
    * **json_response:** (Duplicated, likely for direct import convenience) A shortcut to return a JSON response.

9.  **Static Files (from .static_files):**
    Utilities for managing and serving static assets.

    * **static:** A function to generate URLs for static files.
    * **find_static_file:** A function to locate a static file within the project's static directories.

10. **URL Utilities (from .urls):**
    Utilities related to URL pattern definition.

    * **path:** A function for defining individual URL routes, mapping a URL pattern to a view.

11. **UserManager (from .user_manager):**
    A utility class specifically designed for managing standard user accounts.
    This component provides helper methods for common operations related to users,
    such as creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting user records,
    potentially integrating with the UserRepository.

12. **Validation (from .validation):**
    Components for general data validation beyond form-specific validation.

    * **ValidationError:** A custom exception or class used to signal that validation has failed.
    * **PasswordValidator:** A utility class or function for validating password strength and complexity.
    * **validate_json:** A function to validate if a given string is valid JSON or conforms to a schema.
