"""
This file serves as the initialization point for the 'lback_framework/lback/admin' package.
It is designed to expose the core components necessary for building and managing the
administrative interface within the Lback web framework. This package centralizes the
definition and management of administrative functionalities, including views for
data management, an admin registry, and URL patterns for the admin site.

---

**Key Components Exposed by this Package:**

1.  **admin (from .admin):**
    This likely refers to the main Admin class or instance that orchestrates the
    entire administrative site. It's responsible for managing registered models,
    dispatching requests to appropriate admin views, and potentially handling
    global admin configurations. It acts as the central hub for the administrative interface.

2.  **Admin Views (from .auth_views and .generic):**
    A collection of pre-built views designed to handle common administrative operations
    on data models. These views abstract away boilerplate logic for managing users,
    and performing CRUD operations on generic models within the admin interface.

    * **admin_user_add_view:** A specific view for adding new administrative users.
        This view typically handles the form submission, validation, and creation
        of new admin user accounts.
    * **admin_user_list_view:** A specific view for listing existing administrative users.
        It displays a table or list of admin users, often with options for searching,
        filtering, and pagination.
    * **generic_add_view:** A generic view for adding new instances of any registered model.
        This view provides a standardized interface for creating new records dynamically.
    * **generic_list_view:** A generic view for listing instances of any registered model.
        It displays a table or list of records for a given model, offering general
        management capabilities.
    * **generic_delete_view:** A generic view for deleting instances of any registered model.
        It handles the logic for removing records from the database.
    * **generic_change_view:** A generic view for updating existing instances of any registered model.
        This view provides an interface for modifying existing records.
    * **generic_detail_view:** A generic view for displaying the detailed information of a single
        instance of any registered model.

3.  **AdminRegistry (from .registry):**
    A central registry where application models are registered to be managed by the
    administrative interface. This class keeps track of which models have an admin
    interface defined for them, and how they should be displayed and interacted with.
    It's crucial for dynamically generating admin forms and lists.

4.  **urlpatterns (from .urls):**
    A list or collection of URL patterns specifically for the admin site. These patterns
    map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate admin views, defining the routing
    for all administrative functionalities (e.g., /admin/users/, /admin/products/add/).

5.  **Admin Page Views (from .views):**
    Specific views related to the core administrative user experience, such as login,
    dashboard, and logout functionalities.

    * **admin_login_page:** The view responsible for rendering the administrative login form.
    * **admin_dashboard_page:** The main dashboard view displayed after a successful
        administrative login, providing an overview of the system.
    * **admin_login_post:** The view that handles the submission of the administrative
        login form, processing credentials and authenticating the user.
    * **admin_logout_post:** The view that handles administrative logout requests,
        terminating the user's admin session.
