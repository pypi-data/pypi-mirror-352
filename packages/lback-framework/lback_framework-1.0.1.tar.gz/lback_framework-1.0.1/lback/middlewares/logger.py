    A middleware component for standardized logging of incoming HTTP requests and
    outgoing HTTP responses within the web application.

    This middleware aims to provide a clear and concise log of basic request/response
    flow, which is essential for monitoring application activity, identifying patterns,
    and assisting in general troubleshooting. It also includes a mechanism to filter
    sensitive information like Authorization headers from the logs for security.

        Logs details of the incoming HTTP request.

        This method captures the request method, path, and headers. Sensitive headers,
        such as 'Authorization', are filtered and obfuscated in the logs to prevent
        exposure of sensitive data. It returns None to allow the request to proceed
        through the middleware stack.
