"""
This file serves as the initialization point for the 'lback_framework/lback/commands' package.
It is designed to expose the core components necessary for executing various command-line
utilities and management tasks within the Lback web framework. This package centralizes
the definition and management of administrative and development-related commands,
allowing developers to interact with the framework from the terminal.

---

**Key Components Exposed by this Package:**

1.  **AdminCommands (from .admin):**
    A collection of command-line utilities specifically designed for administrative tasks.
    These commands typically facilitate the management of the Lback admin interface,
    such as creating superusers, managing admin configurations, or performing other
    admin-specific operations from the terminal.

2.  **AppCommands (from .app):**
    A set of command-line utilities related to managing individual applications or modules
    within the Lback project. These commands might include functionalities for creating
    new app templates, managing app-specific configurations, or performing operations
    relevant to the lifecycle of an application.

3.  **setup_database_and_defaults (from .db_seed):**
    A function or utility responsible for seeding the database with initial data or
    default configurations. This command is crucial for setting up a fresh development
    environment or for populating a database with essential data required for the
    application to function correctly (e.g., default user roles, initial settings).

4.  **MigrationCommands (from .migration):**
    A collection of command-line utilities for managing database schema migrations.
    These commands typically integrate with a migration tool (like Alembic) to
    create new migration scripts, apply pending migrations to the database,
    or revert previous migrations, ensuring database schema changes are managed
    in a version-controlled manner.

5.  **ProjectCommands (from .project):**
    A set of command-line utilities related to managing the overall Lback project.
    These commands might include functionalities for initializing a new Lback project,
    setting up project-wide configurations, or performing operations relevant to the
    entire project's structure and environment.

6.  **RunnerCommands (from .runner):**
    A collection of command-line utilities for running the Lback application or
    specific development servers. This typically includes commands to start the
    development server, run tests, or execute other processes necessary for
    developing and deploying the Lback application.
