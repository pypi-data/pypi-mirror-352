    A middleware component that measures and logs the processing time for each HTTP request.

    This middleware injects a start timestamp into the request object during the
    request processing phase and then calculates the total duration when the
    response is being processed. The duration is logged and also added as an
    'X-Response-Time' header to the outgoing response.

        Records the starting timestamp for the incoming request.

        This timestamp is stored as a private attribute `_start_time` on the
        `request` object, which will be used later during response processing
        to calculate the total request duration.

        This method retrieves the `_start_time` from the request object, calculates
        the elapsed time, logs this duration, and adds an `X-Response-Time` header
        to the outgoing response before returning it.
