# Code Quality Metrics

This file tracks code quality metrics over time to help monitor and improve our codebase.

## Metrics Definitions

### Ruff Metrics

- **Issues Count**: Total number of linting issues detected by Ruff
- **Issues by Type**: Distribution of error types (unused imports, undefined names, etc.)

### Radon Complexity Metrics (CC)

- **A**: CC score 1-5 (low complexity)
- **B**: CC score 6-10 (moderate complexity)
- **C**: CC score 11-20 (high complexity)
- **D**: CC score 21-30 (very high complexity)
- **E**: CC score 31-40 (extremely high complexity)
- **F**: CC score 41+ (alarming complexity)

### Radon Maintainability Metrics (MI)

- **A**: MI score 20-100 (high maintainability)
- **B**: MI score 10-19 (medium maintainability)
- **C**: MI score 0-9 (low maintainability)
