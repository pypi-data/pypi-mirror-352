# Create the workflow

#Add nodes

workflow.add_node("ProcessPayment", process_payment)

GraphsÂ¶
At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:

State: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel.

Nodes: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State.

Edges: Python functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current State. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.

By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' Python code.

# In short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next.


1. StateGraph
2. Nodes
3. Edges
## Types of edges 
   1. Starting Edge (here graph.set_entry_point("model"))
   2. Normal Edges (here graph.add_edge("tools","model"))
   3. Conditional Edges (there are where a function is used to determine which nodes to go to first, to create this edge)
       **. Upstream node: the output of this node will be looked at to determine what to do next
       **. A function this will be called to determine which node to call next. it should retrun a string
       **. A mapping this mapping will be used to map output of the function in another node.
    Ex: graph.add_conditional_edge("model",)
4. Compiling the Graph
     **. app=graph.compile()

## Adding messages 
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from operator import add

class State(TypedDict):
foo: int
bar: Annotated[list[str], add]


from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class GraphState(TypedDict):
messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
