    PRIORITY FOCUS:
    - Find the absolute cheapest eggs available in the city
    - DO NOT collect or report average prices across the city
    - Focus only on the prices for a dozen eggs with two types: regular and organic
    
    PRIORITY WEBSITES TO CHECK:
    - Walmart.com: Search for the store location in the target city, navigate to grocery/dairy/eggs
    - Target.com: Find stores in the target city and check their egg inventory and pricing
    - Local grocery chain websites: Check weekly ads/circulars for egg specials and promotions
    
    SCRAPING INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Check store brand/generic options which are typically cheaper
    2. For each specific store location and egg type found, record:
       - Store name and location 
       - Exact egg type and size
       - Date of the pricing and exact URL source
    4. Use the save_egg_price tool to record atleast 10 actual prices with 7 cheapest and 3 most expensive from specific stores.

    QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - All prices must be current (within the past week ONLY)
    - Each price must be verifiable with a direct link where possible

    Return the response in the most concise folrmat withoout using extra words and capturing minimum six prices.
