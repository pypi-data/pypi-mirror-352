# rabin_karp_algorithm

A string searching [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that uses a [rolling hash](computer_science/rolling_hash) to find a pattern in a [string](computer_science/string). It computes the [hash](mathematics/hash_function) of the pattern and the hash of each [substring](computer_science/substring) of the text of the same length as the pattern, and compares them to find matches.
