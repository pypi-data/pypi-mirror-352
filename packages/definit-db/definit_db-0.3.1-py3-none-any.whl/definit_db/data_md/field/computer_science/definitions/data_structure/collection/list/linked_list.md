# linked_list

An ordered [collection](computer_science/collection) of elements. Each element is stored in a [node](mathematics/node) that contains a reference to the next node in the list. Linked lists can be singly linked or doubly linked, depending on whether each node has a reference to the next node only or both the next and previous nodes.
