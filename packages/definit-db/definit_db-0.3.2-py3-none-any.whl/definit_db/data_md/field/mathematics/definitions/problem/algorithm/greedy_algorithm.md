# greedy_algorithm

A type of [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that builds up a [solution](mathematics/solution) piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms do not always produce the [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution), but they are often faster and simpler than other approaches.
