# queue

Queue is a [data structure](computer_science/data_structure) providing first-in-first-out (FIFO) semantics.

Serves as a [collection](computer_science/collection) of elements with two main [operations](computer_science/operation):

- Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear of the queue, and
- Dequeue, which removes an element from the front.

Additionally, a peek [operation](computer_science/operation) can, without modifying the queue, return the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
