# hash_table

Data structure that implements [associative array](computer_science/associative_array) using a [hash function](mathematics/hash_function) to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables are designed to provide fast access to data by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
