# avl_tree

A type of [self-balancing](mathematics/b_tree) [binary search tree](mathematics/binary_search_tree) where the difference in heights between the left and right [subtrees](mathematics/subtree) of any [node](mathematics/node) is at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The AVL tree is named after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis.
