# interval_tree

A type of [binary search tree](mathematics/binary_search_tree) that stores intervals as its keys. Each [node](mathematics/node) in the interval tree represents an interval, and the tree is structured in such a way that it allows for efficient searching of all intervals that overlap with a given interval or point. The intervals are typically represented by their start and end points, and the [tree](mathematics/tree) is [balanced](mathematics/balanced_binary_tree) to ensure efficient search operations.
