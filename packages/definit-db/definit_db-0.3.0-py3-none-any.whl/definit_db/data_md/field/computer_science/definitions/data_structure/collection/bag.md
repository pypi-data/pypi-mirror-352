# bag

A bag is a [collection](computer_science/collection) that allows for the storage of multiple items, where the same item can be stored multiple times. It is similar to a [multiset](mathematics/multiset), but does not require any specific ordering of the items. Removing items is not supported. A bag allows to iterate through the collected items.
