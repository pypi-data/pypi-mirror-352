# red_black_tree

A type of [self-balancing](mathematics/b_tree) [binary search tree](mathematics/binary_search_tree). The red-black tree is named after the colors used to represent the [nodes](mathematics/node). The tree maintains certain properties to ensure that it remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The properties include: 1. Each node is either red or black. 2. The root node is always black. 3. All [leaves](mathematics/leaf) are black. 4. If a red node has children, then both children are black. 5. Every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes. These properties ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
