# quick_sort

QuickSort is a [sorting](mathematics/sorting) [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that uses a [divide_and_conquer](mathematics/divide_and_conquer) approach to sort elements. It selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the other elements into two sub-[sequences](mathematics/sequence) according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot, and then [recursively](mathematics/recursion) sorts the sub-sequences.
