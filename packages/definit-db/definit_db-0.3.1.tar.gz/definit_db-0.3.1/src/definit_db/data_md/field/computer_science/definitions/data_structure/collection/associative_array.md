# associative_array

An [abstract data type](computer_science/abstract_data_type) that [maps](computer_science/map) keys to values. It is a [collection](computer_science/collection) of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value. Associative arrays allow for efficient [operations](computer_science/operation): retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on their keys.
