# trie

A type of [tree](mathematics/tree) data structure that is used to store a dynamic [set](mathematics/set) of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each [node](mathematics/node) in the trie represents a single character of a [string](computer_science/string), and the path from the root to a node represents a prefix of the string. The main advantage of using a trie is that it allows for efficient retrieval of strings with common prefixes.
