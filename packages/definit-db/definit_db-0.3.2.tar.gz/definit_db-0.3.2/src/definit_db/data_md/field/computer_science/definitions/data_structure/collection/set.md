# set

A set is an [abstract data type](computer_science/abstract_data_type) that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a [finite set](mathematics/finite_set). Unlike most other [collection](computer_science/collection) types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.
