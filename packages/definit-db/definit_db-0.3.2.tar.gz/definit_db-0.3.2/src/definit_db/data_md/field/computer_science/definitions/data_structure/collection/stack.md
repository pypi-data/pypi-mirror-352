# stack

Stack is a [data structure](computer_science/data_structure) providing last-in-first-out semantics; also called a LIFO [queue](computer_science/queue).

Serves as a [collection](computer_science/collection) of elements with two main [operations](computer_science/operation):

- Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element.

Additionally, a peek [operation](computer_science/operation) can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name stack is an analogy to a [set](mathematics/set) of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates.
