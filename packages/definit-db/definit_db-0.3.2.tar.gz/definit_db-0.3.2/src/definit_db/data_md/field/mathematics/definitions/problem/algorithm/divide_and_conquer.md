# divide_and_conquer

A type of [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that solves a [problem](mathematics/problem) by [recursively](mathematics/recursion) breaking it down into smaller [subproblems](mathematics/subproblem), solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their [solutions](mathematics/solution) to form a solution to the original problem. Divide and conquer algorithms often lead to efficient and elegant solutions. They may or may not always produce the [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution).
