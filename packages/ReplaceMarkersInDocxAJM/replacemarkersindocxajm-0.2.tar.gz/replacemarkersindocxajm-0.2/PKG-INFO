# <u>ReplaceMarkersInDocxAJM</u>
### <i>Facilitates the process of manipulating placeholders, referred to as "mail merge markers" in a Word document (.docx).</i>


This module provides a class, `ReplaceMarkersInDocx`, that facilitates the process of manipulating placeholders
referred to as "mail merge markers" in a Word document (.docx). It offers features for extracting and replacing
these markers, ensuring seamless customization of document templates used in mail merges or similar scenarios.

Key Features:
- Extract mail merge markers from different parts of a Word document, including paragraphs, headers, and footers.
- Replace markers dynamically with values from an external dictionary (`info_dict`), allowing for the generation
  of customized output documents.
- Validate the integrity of the information dictionary (`info_dict`) against the markers present in the document.
- Modify document styles and alignments based on specific markers.

Dependencies:
- `python-docx` library for manipulating Word documents.
- `abc` module for abstract method definitions.
- `re` module for regular expression handling.

Classes:
- `ReplaceMarkersInDocx`: The main class containing methods and properties to handle placeholders (markers)
  within a Word document. This class also supports customization through class-level constants and initialization
  parameters.

Usage:
The `ReplaceMarkersInDocx` class is designed to be extended for specific use cases. Subclasses should implement
the `standardize_paragraph_style` abstract method as per the desired functionality.

Example:
This module is commonly used to replace placeholders in document templates such as:
- Generating personalized letters.
- Populating certificates with specific recipient information.
- Dynamically modifying document content for mail merge operations.
