This module adds a field *UNECE Payment Mean* on *Technical Payment Methods* to be
able to use a standard written by the [United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe](https://unece.org) (which has 56 members
states in Europe, America and Central Asia, cf
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe)).
This standard define a codification of the payment modes, cf the
[official code
list](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trade/untdid/d99b/tred/tred4461.htm).

This codification is used by the two main international
standards for electronic invoicing:

- [Cross Industry
  Invoice](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/e-invoice)
  (CII),
- [Universal Business Language](https://ubl.xml.org/) (UBL)
