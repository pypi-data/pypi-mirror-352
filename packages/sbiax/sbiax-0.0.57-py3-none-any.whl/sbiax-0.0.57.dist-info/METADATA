`sbiax` is a lightweight library for simulation-based inference (SBI) with a fixed grid of simulations. 

<!-- The design puts the neural density estimator (NDE) models at the centre of the code, allowing for flexible combinations of different models.  -->

### Design

<!-- A typical inference with SBI occurs with  

* fitting a density estimator to a set of simulations and parameters $(\xi, \pi)$ that may be compressed to summary statistics,
* the measurement of a datavector $\hat{\xi}$,
* the sampling of a posterior $p(\pi|\hat{\xi})$ conditioned on the measurement $\hat{\xi}$.

`sbiax` is designed to perform such an inference.  -->

In a typical inference problem the data likelihood is unknown. Using density-estimation SBI, we can proceed by

<!-- Bayesian analyses where the likelihood function is unknown can proceed with density-estimation simulation-based inference methods, which typically involve -->

* simulating a set of data and model parameters $\{(\boldsymbol{\xi}, \boldsymbol{\pi})_0, ..., (\boldsymbol{\xi}, \boldsymbol{\pi})_N\}$,
* obtaining a measurement $\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$,
* compressing the simulations and the measurements - usually with a neural network or linear compression - to a set of summaries $\{(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\pi})_0, ..., (\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\pi})_N\}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$, 
* fitting an ensemble of normalising flow or similar density estimation algorithms (e.g. a Gaussian mixture model),
* the optional optimisation of the parameters for the architecture and fitting hyperparameters of the algorithms,
* sampling the ensemble posterior (using an MCMC sampler if the likelihood is fit directly) conditioned on the datavector to obtain parameter constraints on the parameters of a physical model, $\boldsymbol{\pi}$.

`sbiax` is a code for implementing each of these steps.


<!-- #### a) Configuration

An inference is defined by a `config` file. This is a dictionary that includes

* the architecture(s) of the NDEs,
* how to train these models,
* how to sample these models (e.g. MCMC, ...),
* where to save models, posteriors and figures,
* and generally any other information for your experiments.

NDEs are grouped in an ensemble that defines its own ensemble-likelihood function given an observation.

#### b) Density estimation

A posterior or likelihood is derived from a set of simulations and parameters by fitting a generative model with some loss - this may be a diffusion model or a normalising flow. 

`sbiax` is designed to be centred around these algorithms and to adopt the latest innovations from the machine learning literature.

#### c) Compression 

Density estimation is one of the oldest problems in machine learning. To avoid the difficulties of fitting high-dimensional models to data it is common to compress the data. 

`sbiax` gives you common compression methods that use linear methods or neural networks.  -->
