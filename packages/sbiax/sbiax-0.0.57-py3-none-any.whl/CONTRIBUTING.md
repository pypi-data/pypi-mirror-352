# Contributing

Contributions (pull requests) are welcome! Here's how to get started.

**Getting started**

First fork the library on GitHub.

Then clone and install the library in development mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/sbiax.git
cd sbiax/ 
pip install -e .
```

**If you're making changes to the code:**

Now make your changes. Make sure to include additional tests if necessary.

Next verify the tests all pass by running `pytest` to check your new changes work:

```bash
cd sbiax/tests/
pip install requirements.txt
pytest
```

Then push your changes back to your fork of the repository:

```bash
git push
```

Finally, open a pull request on GitHub!
