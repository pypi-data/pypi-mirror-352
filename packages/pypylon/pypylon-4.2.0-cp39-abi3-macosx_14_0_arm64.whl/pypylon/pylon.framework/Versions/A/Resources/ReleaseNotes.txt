                    dialogs. Now, the user's root directory is used.


RESTRICTIONS
============
* pylon Viewer: A new image throttle has been implemented in the pylon Viewer to
                improve overall stability and performance. This introduces a new
                restriction which affects the video recording feature of the
                pylon Viewer. Allowing only 250 images per second and camera in
                the imaging pipeline limits the ability to record every frame
                when exceeding this limit.
* pylon Viewer: The Color Calibrator does not support all Basler color cameras.
                Due to a different camera feature set, Basler dart and boost V
                cameras are not supported.
* pylon Viewer: Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
                the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been
                opened in the pylon Viewer. To prevent this, close the camera
                before using the Color Calibrator.
* pylon Viewer: Images grabbed by Stereo ace 2 cameras can't be displayed yet.
* Workbench: Using multiple pin data views actively displaying data in the
             Workbench may cause
             an increase of the CPU load and degradation of the overall
             performance. Basler
             recommends using fewer pin data views whenever possible.
* Workbench: The Statistics feature of the Workbench measures the execution
             times of vTools.
             The times measured in the Statistics feature may vary depending on
             the configuration of your
             system and the overall CPU load. This is so, because CPUs may run
             with different frequencies
             depending on the current load (e.g., due to dynamic frequency
             scaling).
* vTools: Sometimes, loading compressed recipes fails. Until there is a
          workaround, avoid working with compressed recipes.
* pylon C++ SDK: Some ace 2 cameras may use a Boolean parameter instead of the
                 usual enumeration for event notifications. The following code
                 snippets can be used to work around this issue. For C++ you can
                 use: CBooleanParameter(camera.GetNodeMap(),
                 "EventNotification").TrySetValue(true); in addition to:
                 camera.EventNotification.TrySetValue(EventNotification_On);
* GigE: For optimum use of Basler's ace 2 5GigE and 1GigE cameras, Basler
        recommends using dual-channel DDR4-3600 RAM or better. Using slower RAM
        may cause buffer underruns and image loss. In addition, Basler
        recommends using the pylon GigE Configurator tool to optimize the
        complete setup.
* GenTL: Limited GenTL support for producers with GenTL version 1.4 and below.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with resolutions of 20 MP or higher
       may fail, if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. As a
       workaround, set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4: The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond feature in
       ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression Beyond
       feature is enabled, the pylon Viewer first disables the Compression
       Beyond feature in the camera and then starts recording.
* GenTL/GigE: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action
              commands.
* GenTL/GigE: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast
              configurations.

CORRECTIONS
===========
* GenTL: [172316] Fixed an issue in the ProducerU3V.cti and ProducerGEV.cti producers, 
         where EventGetData could return custom error code -10001 instead of
         GC_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL when the buffer passed was too small.
* GenTL: [184792] The access mode of the InterfaceUpdateList has been changed to 
         write-only.
* GigE Vision  [158474] Unicasts and directed broadcasts, of ActionCommands and
        ScheduledActionCommands, are only sent if the request subnet matches the
        subnet of the IP address. This will reduce unexpected delays if a
        gateway or routing is required.

                has been adapted to correctly display the brightness range when using the 
                Basler SLP Strobe Controller. 
* pylon Viewer: [182085] The position of GigE cameras in the Devices pane does not change 
                anymore after enumeration. 
* pylon Viewer: [189875] The pylon Viewer can grab images after changing the IP address of 
                the network adapter without having to close and reopen the pylon Viewer. 
                The refresh button must be clicked before opening the camera if Auto-Scan 
                is disabled.
* pylon Viewer: [189905] Fixed an issue with the "Don't show this dialog again" option in 
                the Bandwidth Manager.


RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* Setup: If the *.pkg package fails to install, right-click the *.pkg package and select 
         Open to continue. This may occur if macOS can’t read the Basler certificate.
* SDK: Some ace 2 cameras may use a boolean parameter instead of the usual enumeration 
       for event notifications. The following code snippets can be used to work around 
       this issue.
       For C++ you can use:
         CBooleanParameter(camera.GetNodeMap(), "EventNotification").TrySetValue(true);
       in addition to:   
         camera.EventNotification.TrySetValue(EventNotification_On);
* GigE Vision: On some macOS Catalina versions, e.g., 10.15.4, the camera enumeration in the 
       pylon Viewer or the pylon API may take longer than 60 seconds. To prevent that either 
       use an older macOS version or check for future macOS updates.
* pylon Viewer: The pylon Viewer requires macOS version 10.13 or newer.
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
        your system. 
* pylon Viewer: Clicking Reset Window Layout while running the pylon Viewer in full-screen mode, 
        will minimize the pylon Viewer and the image window may disappear and become undocked. 
        You may need to stop/start the image acquisition to display the image window again. 
        To avoid this, Basler recommends using the Reset Window Layout feature only when the 
        pylon Viewer is not in full-screen mode.
* IP Configurator: The IP Configurator tool requires macOS version 10.12 or newer.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
       fully supported by the IP Configurator tool. 
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* BPD: When using the offline Basler Product Documentation with the Safari browser on macOS 
       Catalina 10.15.x, the forwarding to the BPD and any internal links will not work correctly. 
       To fix the forwarding issue, choose Safari > Preferences > Advanced. Select “Show Develop 
       menu in menu bar”. In the Safari menu bar, choose Develop > Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
       use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).

       that were written for GigE cameras based on GenICam SFNC 1.x so
       that they work with GigE cameras based on SFNC 2.x as well, e.g.,
       Basler ace 2 GigE cameras.
* SDK: [139226] Added the Utility_IpConfig sample, which illustrates how to configure the IP
       address of GigE cameras. In addition, this sample can be used to automatically and
	   programmatically configure multiple GigE Vision cameras.

       the compression feature in Basler ace 2 Pro cameras and how to decompress the images
	   using the CImageDecompressor class.
* SDK: [144475] New parameters for Basler ace 2 Pro camera and the Basler SLP Controller have been
       added to the CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class.
* SDK/USB3: [149732] A new stream grabber statistic parameter called “Statistic_Out_Of_Memory_Error_Count”
            has been added. It provides information about insufficient memory on the host.

       actual size of the grab result buffer.
* SDK: [136974] Added additional enumeration entries with correct GrabStatus_ prefix to EGrabStatus
       to conform with the naming scheme of enumerations. Old entries can still be used for
       backwards compatibility.

       e.g., CIntegerParameter.
       These can be used instead of GenApi::CXYZPtr classes.
* SDK: [100038] Changed the existing configuration classes, e.g., CAcquireContinuousConfiguration,
       to use new parameter classes.
* SDK: [100038] Access methods and keys of transport layer-specific device info
       classes have been merged into CDeviceInfo.
* SDK: [102881] The image format converter now also supports the PixelType_YCbCr422_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar
       and PixelType_YCbCr420_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar input formats.
* SDK: [121880] Buffers can be cleared (filled with 0) using the ClearBufferModeEnable
       parameter of the InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120870] Calling AcquisitionStart and AcquisitionStop in InstantCamera can be enabled
       or disabled using the parameter AcquisitionStartStopExecutionEnable of the
       InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [133422] If the DeviceUserID of the camera is empty, an empty UserDefinedName entry
       will be added to the DeviceInfo object.
* SDK: [132430] Added missing documentation for CTlFactory functions.
* USB3: [55923] The Libusb error memory limit handling has been improved.
* GigE Vision: [126099] Added mapping of YCbCr422_8 pixel type to
                Pylon::PixelType_YUV422_YUYV_Packed in GigE Vision transport layer
                for ace 2 GigE cameras.
* CamEmu: [102456] CamEmu now also supports BayerGR8, BayerRG8, BayerGB8, and
          BayerBG8 pixel formats.
* BPD: [152178] Updated the Basler Product Documentation to version 33.
