3.2. LICENSE OPTIONS

3.2.1. NODELOCKED LICENSES.
A Nodelocked License allows CUSTOMER to install and use the Software only on the computer specified in the 
Nodelocked License File. The computer is specified by a Host ID that is derived from a certain hardware 
component, which may be bound to an irremovable computer component ("Irremovable Host ID"), for example, 
a network card, or may be bound to a removable hardware component ("Removable Host ID"), for example, a dongle. 
If CUSTOMER uses an Irremovable Host ID for licensing the SOFTWARE, CUSTOMER may only install and use the 
SOFTWARE on the computer that includes the Irremovable Host ID. If CUSTOMER uses a Removable Host ID, CUSTOMER 
may install the SOFTWARE on any number of computers, but CUSTOMER may only use the SOFTWARE on the computer to 
which the Removable Host ID is attached.

3.2.2. COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSES.
CUSTOMER undertakes to keep true, accurate, and consistent books and records containing regular entries 
relating to duplication and installations of the SOFTWARE and sales, distributions, or other transfers of 
Derivatives. BASLER, its authorized representative, or its accountants (as determined by BASLER) may, for the 
purpose of confirming CUSTOMER's compliance with the terms hereof, enter CUSTOMER's place of business on 
reasonable written notice, but not less than twenty (20) business days, during normal business hours once per 
year during the term of this AGREEMENT and once following the termination or expiration of this AGREEMENT. 
BASLER, its authorized representative or its accountants shall be entitled to perform an audit of CUSTOMER's 
relevant books, records, and software systems, and receive any explanations that may reasonably be requested. 
BASLER shall be responsible for its costs incurred in connection with any such audit, provided that CUSTOMER 
shall reimburse BASLER for the cost of the audit if the examination discloses an underpayment to BASLER of 
more than five percent (5%) of the payments due with respect to any applicable period. Any further rights of 
BASLER remain unaffected.  This Section 3.2.2 shall survive any termination or expiration of this AGREEMENT 
for a period of three (3) years. CUSTOMER further agrees that upon request from BASLER or BASLER's authorized 
representative, CUSTOMER will within thirty (30) days fully document and certify that use of any and all 
SOFTWARE at the time of the request is in conformity with CUSTOMER's valid licenses from BASLER.

3.3. DOCUMENTATION.
CUSTOMER may make and use a reasonable number of copies of any Documentation, provided that such copies shall 
be used only for internal purposes and are not to be published, distributed or otherwise made available 
(either in hard copy or electronic form) outside CUSTOMER's organization. In particular, CUSTOMER may not 
forward any Documentation to CUSTOMER's customers in connection with the Derivatives or to any other third 
party.

notices that appear on and in the SOFTWARE.

5.3. LIMITATION ON REVERSE ENGINEERING.
CUSTOMER shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the 
source code of the SOFTWARE or the file format or content of its Protected Data, unless (a) this 
source code is provided by BASLER (e.g. for open source components) and/or (b) CUSTOMER is permitted 
to do so under applicable statutory law that cannot be modified by this AGREEMENT.  If it is essential 
to do so in order to achieve interoperability of the SOFTWARE with other software programs, CUSTOMER 
shall request BASLER to provide the information necessary to achieve such interoperability and BASLER 
will provide such information upon mutual consent.
In this case, BASLER has the right to request (a) acceptance of reasonable contractual conditions by 
CUSTOMER and/or (b) a reasonable financial compensation before providing such information.  Any 
information supplied by BASLER to achieve interoperability is strictly confidential, protected by 
applicable laws and must only be used by CUSTOMER for the purpose described herein and may not be 
disclosed to any third party.
CUSTOMER may not modify, adapt, or otherwise alter the SOFTWARE or Protected Data except as expressly 
permitted herein.  In particular, CUSTOMER may not attempt to remove, override, modify, change or 
otherwise temper with any protection mechanisms of the SOFTWARE or any part thereof.

5.4. UPGRADES.
Different rights and obligations apply to the Software Configurations as listed in the following 
provisions.

5.4.1. RUNTIME VERSION. 
If the SOFTWARE in its Runtime Version is an upgrade to a previous version of the SOFTWARE, CUSTOMER 
must possess a valid license to such previous version in order to use the upgrade. 
CUSTOMER may continue to use the previous version of the SOFTWARE on CUSTOMER's computer(s) after 
CUSTOMER received the upgrade, provided that (i) the previous version or copies thereof are not 
transferred to another party or computer unless all copies of the upgrade are also transferred to such 
party or computer; and (ii) CUSTOMER acknowledges that any obligation BASLER may have to support the 
previous version of the SOFTWARE ends upon availability of the upgrade.

5.5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
All intellectual property rights in the SOFTWARE are owned by BASLER or its 
suppliers and are protected by intellectual property, in particular, without limitation, by copyright 
laws and international copyright treaties. CUSTOMER shall not remove any product identification, 
copyright notices or proprietary restrictions from the SOFTWARE. The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

5.6. TERMINATION.
Without prejudice to any other rights, BASLER may terminate this AGREEMENT if CUSTOMER 
fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT. In such event, CUSTOMER must destroy 
all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its components as well as any and all Derivatives.


6. LIMITED WARRANTY.
BASLER warrants to CUSTOMER that the performance and functionality of the SOFTWARE purchased by CUSTOMER 
will in all material aspects comply with the Documentation for a period of twelve (12) months following 
receipt of the SOFTWARE, provided that the SOFTWARE is used on a recommended hardware configuration. The 
aforementioned warranty is extended for the period of the applicable statute of limitations in cases 
where a deviation of the SOFTWARE from the Documentation is caused by BASLER's gross negligence or willful 
misconduct.
BASLER expressly excludes all liability for non-substantial variations of performance of the SOFTWARE from 
the Documentation, which do not affect the core functionalities of and the results achieved with the SOFTWARE. 
This warranty does not apply to updates, upgrades, pre-releases, or to SOFTWARE that has been altered by 
CUSTOMER, to the extent such alterations caused a defect. To make a warranty claim, CUSTOMER must return the 
SOFTWARE to the location where CUSTOMER obtained it along with proof of purchase within the period of time 
set forth above. If the SOFTWARE does not perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, BASLER 
may, in its sole discretion repair or replace the SOFTWARE.
EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASLER AND 
ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES 
OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES ALL WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 
Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on the duration of 
implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to CUSTOMER in its entirety.


7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

7.1. CUSTOMER acknowledges that using or selling SOFTWARE in devices or systems where malfunction may result 
in personal injury, death, damage to property or the environment is at its own risk and agrees to indemnify 
and BASLER harmless from all losses and damages (including legal fees) which may be incurred by BASLER as a 
result of any claims or actions resulting from damages caused by the use of the SOFTWARE in such devices or 
systems by CUSTOMER or any party the CUSTOMER has directly or indirectly supplied the SOFTWARE to.

7.2. BASLER, its legal representatives and vicarious agents shall - irrespective of the legal ground - only be 
liable for damages if the damage was caused through BASLER's culpable breach of a major contractual obligation 
(cardinal duty), gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any further liability for damages is expressly 
excluded unless set forth otherwise below.

7.3. Subject to this Section 7.4., if BASLER is liable for the violation of a major contractual obligation in 
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, such liability for damage shall be limited to damages, 
which were foreseeable by BASLER at the time when the contract with the CUSTOMER became effective.

7.4. BASLER shall in no event be liable for indirect or consequential damages, loss of profit, loss of business 
or commercial opportunities, loss of or damage to goodwill or reputation.

to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (High Risk Use). CUSTOMER agrees that 
CUSTOMER may not use the SOFTWARE in such High Risk Use scenarios.


9. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.
This AGREEMENT shall be considered to have been entered into and construed in accordance with the laws of 
Germany to the exclusion of the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods (CISG). The District Court (Landgericht) Hamburg shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes
