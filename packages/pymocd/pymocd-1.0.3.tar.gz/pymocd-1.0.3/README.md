### Understanding Community Detection with HP-MOCD

The `HP-MOCD` algorithm, central to `pymocd`, identifies community structures within a graph. It proposes a solution by grouping nodes into distinct communities, as illustrated below:

| Original Graph                         | Proposed Community Structure             |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|  ![](res/original_graph.png)           | ![](res/proposed_solution.png)           |

### Getting Started

Installing the library using pip interface:

```bash
pip install pymocd
```

For an easy usage:

```python
import networkx
import pymocd

G = networkx.Graph() # Your graph
alg = pymocd.HpMocd(G)
communities = alg.run()
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphs must be provided in **NetworkX compatible format**.

Refer to the official **[Documentation](https://oliveira-sh.github.io/pymocd/)** for detailed instructions and more usage examples.

  abstract  = {Community detection in social networks has traditionally been approached as a single-objective optimization problem, with various heuristics targeting specific community-defining metrics. However, this approach often proves inadequate for capturing the multifaceted nature of communities. We introduce HP-MOCD, a fully parallelized, evolutionary high-performance multi-objective community detection algorithm designed specifically for large-scale networks. Our implementation overcomes the computational challenges that typically limit multi-objective approaches in this domain. While performance may decrease with networks containing high proportions of inter-community edges, extensive evaluations on synthetic datasets demonstrate that HP-MOCD achieves an exceptional balance between scalability and detection accuracy. Available as open-source software, HP-MOCD offers researchers and practitioners a practical, powerful solution for complex network analysis, particularly for applications requiring both efficiency and detection quality.},
