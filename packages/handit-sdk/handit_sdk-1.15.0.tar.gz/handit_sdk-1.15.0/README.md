### **Installation**

Install the SDK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install handit-sdk
```

---

### **Getting Started**

#### **1. Configure the SDK**

Set up the SDK with your API key and tracking server URL (optional):

```python
from handit_tracker import HanditTracker

tracker = HanditTracker()
tracker.config(api_key="your-api-key", tracking_url="https://your-custom-tracking-url.com")
```

---

#### **2. Automatically Intercept HTTP Requests**

Wrap your `requests` library calls to automatically capture data:

```python
import requests
from handit_tracker import HanditTracker

tracker = HanditTracker()
tracker.config(api_key="your-api-key")

# Intercept requests
@tracker.intercept_requests
def make_request(url, **kwargs):
    return requests.get(url, **kwargs)

response = make_request("https://example.com/api/data")
```

---

#### **3. Manually Capture Model Data**

Manually capture model input and output data for specific events:

```python
tracker.capture_model(
    model_id="model-slug",
    request_body={"input_key": "input_value"},
    response_body={"output_key": "output_value"}
)
```

---

### **Advanced Features**

1. **Update Tracked URLs Dynamically**  
   The SDK automatically fetches the list of URLs to track from the configured tracking server.

2. **Customizable Model ID Extraction**  
   Adjust the logic for extracting `model_id` from the URL based on your API's structure.

3. **Error Handling and Reporting**  
   Automatically report errors and failed API responses for improved visibility into issues.
