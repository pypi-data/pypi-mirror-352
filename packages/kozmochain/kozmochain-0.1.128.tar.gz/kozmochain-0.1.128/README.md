## What is Kozmochain?

Kozmochain is an Open Source Framework for personalizing LLM responses. It makes it easy to create and deploy personalized AI apps. At its core, Kozmochain follows the design principle of being *"Conventional but Configurable"* to serve both software engineers and machine learning engineers.

Kozmochain streamlines the creation of personalized LLM applications, offering a seamless process for managing various types of unstructured data. It efficiently segments data into manageable chunks, generates relevant embeddings, and stores them in a vector database for optimized retrieval. With a suite of diverse APIs, it enables users to extract contextual information, find precise answers, or engage in interactive chat conversations, all tailored to their own data.

## üîß Quick install

### Python API

```bash
pip install kozmochain
```

## ‚ú® Live demo

</p>

For example, you can create an Elon Musk bot using the following code:

```python
import os
from kozmochain import App

# Create a bot instance
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
app = App()

# Embed online resources
app.add("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk")
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Query the app
app.query("How many companies does Elon Musk run and name those?")
# Answer: Elon Musk currently runs several companies. As of my knowledge, he is the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, the CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., the CEO and founder of Neuralink, and the CEO and founder of The Boring Company. However, please note that this information may change over time, so it's always good to verify the latest updates.
