# Navband Visited IDA Pro Plugin

IDA Pro plugin that tracks and records all disassembly addresses you visit during your analysis, highlighting these visited addresses in IDA's navigation band.

## Features

-   Automatically records addresses as you navigate through them in the disassembly view.
-   Colors the corresponding locations in the navigation band (navband) black to indicate they have been visited.
-   Persists as long as IDA is open, helping you keep track of explored code regions.
