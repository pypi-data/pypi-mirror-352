.. WARNING::
   Currently broken and under construction: this is a test distribution.
   Please wait for the beta release.

libembroidery is a low-level library for reading, writing, 
and altering digital embroidery files in C. `libembroidery` in Python
is a hand-guided translation of the C code for Python applications.

libembroidery is the underlying library that is used by
[Embroidermodder 2](http://www.libembroidery.org)
and is developed by [The Embroidermodder Team](#the-embroidermodder-team).
It handles over 45 different embroidery specific formats as well
as several non-embroidery specific vector formats.

If you want to learn more about building, using and developing this software read the
manual (included as the file [embroidermodder_manual.pdf](embroidermodder_manual.pdf)).

    p.save("circle.dst", emb.FORMAT_DST)

## Installation

We recommend you install the working draft using

    python3 setup.py install --user

from the top level.

In the future we'd recommend that you use the current most
up-to-date version on PyPI using:

    python3 -m pip install libembroidery

or

    py -m pip install libembroidery

on Windows.
