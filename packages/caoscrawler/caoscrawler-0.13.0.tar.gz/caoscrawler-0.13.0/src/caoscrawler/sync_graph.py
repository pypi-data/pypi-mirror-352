class SyncGraph:
    """
    A data model class for the graph of entities that shall be created during synchronization of
    the crawler.

    The SyncGraph combines nodes in the graph based on their identity in order to create a graph of
    objects that can either be inserted or updated in(to) the remote server. This combination of
    SyncNodes happens during initialization and later on when the ID of SyncNodes is set.

    When the SyncGraph is initialized, the properties of given entities are scanned and used to
    create multiple reference maps that track how SyncNodes reference each other.
    These maps are kept up to date when SyncNodes are merged because they are identified with each
    other. During initialization, SyncNodes are first merged based on their ID, path or
    identifiable.

    When additional information is added to the graph by setting the ID of a node
    (via `set_id_of_node`) then the graph is updated accordingly:
    - if this information implies that the node is equivalent to another node (e.g. has same ID),
      then they are merged
    - if knowing that one node does not exist in the remote server, then this might imply that some
      other node also does not exist if its identity relies on the latter.
    - The new ID might make it possible to create the identifiables of connected nodes and thus
      might trigger further merging of nodes based on the new identifiables.

    A SyncGraph should only be manipulated via one function:
    - set_id_of_node: a positive integer means the Entity exists, None means it is missing
    TODO what about String IDs

    The SyncGraph can be converted back to lists of entities which allow to perform the desired
    inserts and updates.

    Usage:
    - Initialize the Graph with a list of entities. Those will be converted to the SyncNodes of the
      graph.
    - SyncNodes that can be merged are automatically merged and SyncNodes where the existence can
      be determined are automatically removed from the list of unchecked SyncNodes:
      graph.unchecked.
    - You manipulate the graph by setting the ID of a SyncNode (either to a valid ID or to None).
      For example, you can check whether a SyncNode has an identifiable and then query the remote
      server and use the result to set the ID.
    - After each manipulation, the graph updates accordingly (see above)
    - Ideally, the unchecked list is empty after some manipulation.
    - You can export a list of entities to be inserted and one of entities to be updated with
      export_record_lists.

    # General implementation remark:
    # There are three cases where an update of one SyncNode can affect other nodes:
    # - mark existing (add identifiables)
    # - mark missing (add identifiables and add (negative) IDs)
    # - merge (add identifiables)
    #
    # We cannot get an infinite recursion where one update triggers another update and so on
    # because updates are conditional:
    # Setting an ID removes the node (immediately) from the unchecked list and it is only tried to
    # set an ID in _mark_missing if a node is in the uncheck list. Thus, setting the ID once
    # prevents future attempts to set the ID of the same node.
    # Also, setting an identifiable is only done when needed, i.e. there is no identifiable.
    # Note, that when ever one node is changed, we check all dependent nodes (see usage of
    # `_get_nodes_whose_identity_relies_on`) whether something should be updated. Thus, we cannot
