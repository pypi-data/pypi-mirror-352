[![Install with UVX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Microsoft_Fabric_RTI_MCP_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=ms-fabric-rti&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp%22%5D%7D) [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp)](https://pepy.tech/projects/microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp)
## üéØ Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI)](https://aka.ms/fabricrti). 
This server enables AI agents to interact with Fabric RTI services by providing tools through the MCP interface, allowing for seamless data querying and analysis capabilities.

### üîç How It Works

The Fabric RTI MCP Server creates a seamless integration between AI agents and Fabric RTI services through:

- üîÑ Smart JSON communication that AI agents understand
- üèóÔ∏è Natural language commands that get translated to Kql operations
- üí° Intelligent parameter suggestions and auto-completion!
- ‚ö° Consistent error handling that makes sense

### ‚ú® Supported Services
- **Eventhouse (Kusto)**: Execute KQL queries against Microsoft Fabric RTI [Eventhouse](https://aka.ms/eventhouse) and [Azure Data Explorer(ADX)](https://aka.ms/adx).

## üöß Coming soon
- **Activator**
- **Eventstreams**
- **Other RTI items**

### üîç Explore your data

- "Get databases in Eventhouse'"
- "Sample 10 rows from table 'StormEvents' in Eventhouse"
- "What can you tell me about StormEvents data?"
- "Analyze the StormEvents to come up with trend analysis ocross past 10 years of data"
- "Analyze the commands in 'CommandExecution' table and categorize them as low/medium/high risks"


### Available tools 
- List databases
- List tables
- Get schema for a table
- Sample rows from a table
- Execute query
- Ingest a csv

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install either the stable or Insiders release of VS Code:
   * [üí´ Stable release](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   * [üîÆ Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions
3. Install `uv`  
```ps
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```  
or, check here for [other install options](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)

4. Open VS Code in an empty folder


### Install from PyPI (Pip)
The Fabric RTI MCP Server is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp/), so you can install it using pip. This is the easiest way to install the server.

#### From VS Code
    1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the command `MCP: Add Server`
    2. Select install from Pip
    3. When prompted, enter the package name `fabric-rti-mcp`
    4. Follow the prompts to install the package and add it to your settings.json file

The process should end with the below settings in your `settings.json` file.

#### settings.json
```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "server": {
            "fabric-rti-mcp": {
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": [
                    "microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### üîß Manual Install (Install from source)  

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed properly and added to your PATH.
2. Clone the repository
3. Install the dependencies (`pip install .` or `uv tool install .`)
4. Add the settings below into your vscode `settings.json` file. 
5. Change the path to match the repo location on your machine.
6. Change the cluster uri in the settings to match your cluster.

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "kusto-mcp": {
                "command": "uv",
                "args": [
                    "--directory",
                    "C:/path/to/fabric-rti-mcp/",
                    "run",
                    "-m",
                    "fabric_rti_mcp.server"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üêõ Debugging the MCP Server locally
Assuming you have python installed and the repo cloned:

### Install locally
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Configure

Add the server to your
```
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "local-fabric-rti-mcp": {
                "command": "python",
                "args": [
                    "-m",
                    "fabric_rti_mcp.server"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Attach the debugger
Use the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` to attach to the running server. 
Once VS Code picks up the server and starts it, navigate to it's output: 
1. Open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the command `MCP: List Servers`
2. Navigate to `local-fabric-rti-mcp` and select `Show Output`
3. Pick up the process id (PID) of the server from the output
4. Run the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` file, and paste the PID of the server in the prompt
5. The debugger will attach to the server process, and you can start debugging


## üß™ Test the MCP Server

1. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
2. You should see the Fabric RTI MCP Server in the list of tools
3. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use the Eventhouse tools, such as "List my Kusto tables"
4. The agent should be able to use the Fabric RTI MCP Server tools to complete your query


## üîë Authentication

The MCP Server seamlessly integrates with your host operating system's authentication mechanisms, making it super easy to get started! We use Azure Identity under the hood via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac), which tries these credentials in order:

1. **Environment Variables** (`EnvironmentCredential`) - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
1. **Visual Studio** (`VisualStudioCredential`) - Uses your Visual Studio credentials
1. **Azure CLI** (`AzureCliCredential`) - Uses your existing Azure CLI login
1. **Azure PowerShell** (`AzurePowerShellCredential`) - Uses your Az PowerShell login
1. **Azure Developer CLI** (`AzureDeveloperCliCredential`) - Uses your azd login
1. **Interactive Browser** (`InteractiveBrowserCredential`) - Falls back to browser-based login if needed

If you're already logged in through any of these methods, the Fabric RTI MCP Server will automatically use those credentials.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.
