# test_installation.py - Context Documentation

## Purpose

This module provides comprehensive end-to-end testing for Dungeon Master installation and basic workflow functionality. It serves as both a validation tool for developers and a confidence check for users installing the package. The tests simulate real-world usage scenarios including package import, CLI functionality, and complete workflow execution in temporary environments to ensure the system works correctly after installation.

## Usage Summary

**File Location**: `tests/test_installation.py`

**Primary Use Cases**:

- Validate that Dungeon Master can be imported correctly after installation
- Test CLI commands and console script functionality
- Execute complete workflow scenarios in isolated environments
- Provide installation confidence for users and CI/CD systems
- Debug installation issues across different environments

**Key Dependencies**:

- `sys`: Python interpreter access and module path manipulation
- `subprocess`: Execute CLI commands and capture output for validation
- `tempfile`: Create isolated test environments without affecting the working directory
- `os`: Operating system interface for directory changes and environment setup
- `pathlib.Path`: Modern path handling for cross-platform compatibility

## Key Functions or Classes

**Key Functions**:

- **test_import()**: Validates that the Dungeon Master package can be imported and reports version information
- **test_cli()**: Tests CLI help functionality and console script availability in the system PATH
- **test_workflow()**: Comprehensive end-to-end test that simulates a complete user workflow in a temporary git repository
- **main()**: Test runner that executes all tests and provides detailed reporting of results

## Usage Notes

- Tests run in isolated temporary directories to avoid affecting the development environment
- The workflow test creates a complete git repository with proper configuration for realistic testing
- Console script testing helps identify PATH issues that users might encounter
- Tests provide detailed feedback about what succeeded and what failed for troubleshooting
- The module is designed to be run immediately after package installation as a sanity check
- All subprocess calls include timeout and error handling to prevent hanging tests

## Dependencies & Integration

This test module serves as a quality gate for the entire Dungeon Master system:

- **Tests**: All major Dungeon Master functionality through CLI commands
- **Uses**: Standard library modules only to avoid circular dependencies
- **Integration with**: Git workflows, file system operations, and CLI command execution
- **Quality assurance flow**:
  1. Package import validation ensures installation succeeded
  2. CLI testing validates command structure and help system
  3. Workflow testing exercises the complete user experience
  4. Results provide confidence that the system is ready for production use

The installation tests are particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines and user onboarding scenarios.
