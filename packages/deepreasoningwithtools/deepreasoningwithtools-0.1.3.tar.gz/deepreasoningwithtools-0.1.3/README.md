Deep Reasoning Tools is a powerful Python library that helps integrate tool calling into reasoning traces, built on top of the smolagents local Python interpreter. It provides a flexible framework for creating AI agents from reasoning agents that can use tools and perform complex reasoning tasks.

## Features

- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrate custom tools into AI agent reasoning
- **Multiple Model Support**: Built-in support for both LiteLLM and vLLM models
- **Flexible Sampling**: Abstract sampler interface for custom model implementations
- **Secure Execution**: Controlled Python environment with authorized imports
- **Streaming Support**: Asynchronous generation with streaming responses
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and samplers

## Installation
For VLLM:
```bash
pip install deepreasoningwithtools[vllm]
```
For Litellm:
```bash
pip install deepreasoningwithtools[litellm]
```
## Quick Start

```python
from deepreasoningwithtools.toolcaller import ToolCaller
from deepreasoningwithtools.samplers import LiteLLMSampler
from deepreasoningwithtools.tools.yfinance_tools import StockPriceTool
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize the tool caller with a LiteLLM model
toolcaller = ToolCaller(
    sampler=LiteLLMSampler(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    authorized_imports=["pandas"]
)

# Add tools
tools = [StockPriceTool(cutoff_date=datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))]

# Generate responses
async for output in toolcaller.generate(
    user_prompt="What was Apple's stock price last week?",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant...",
    tools=tools
):
    print(output, end="")
```

## Architecture

### ToolCaller

The `ToolCaller` class is the main interface for integrating tools with language models. It manages the execution environment, tool registration, and interaction between the language model and tools.

#### Initialization Parameters

The ToolCaller constructor takes the following parameters:

```python
def __init__(self, sampler: AbstractSampler, authorized_imports: list[str] = []):
```

- `sampler` (required): An instance of `AbstractSampler` that handles model inference. This can be either:
  - `LiteLLMSampler` for cloud-based models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo)
  - `VLLMSampler` for local models (e.g., Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B)
- `authorized_imports` (optional): A list of Python package names that are allowed to be imported in the execution environment. Defaults to an empty list. This provides security by restricting which packages can be used in code execution.

Example initialization:
```python
toolcaller = ToolCaller(
    sampler=LiteLLMSampler(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    authorized_imports=["pandas", "numpy", "requests"]
)
```

The ToolCaller delegates the actual model inference to the provided sampler while managing the tool execution environment. It:

1. Uses the sampler to generate model responses
2. Manages the conversation flow and tool execution
3. Handles the secure Python environment for code execution

The ToolCaller provides two main methods:

1. `generate(system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str, tools: list[Tool] = [])`:
   - Takes a system prompt (must include `{tool_desc}` placeholder), user prompt, and optional list of tools
   - Initializes a Python execution environment with authorized imports
   - Registers the provided tools and generates their descriptions
   - Creates a message history starting with system and user prompts
   - Uses the sampler to generate model responses
   - Streams the model's response, handling code blocks and tool execution
   - Returns an async generator yielding both model outputs and tool execution results


The ToolCaller works by:
1. Taking a system prompt that includes a `{tool_desc}` placeholder
2. Automatically replacing `{tool_desc}` with formatted descriptions of all registered tools
3. Using the provided sampler to generate model responses
4. Managing the conversation flow between the model and tools
5. Executing code blocks in a controlled environment
6. Streaming both model outputs and tool execution results

Example of how the ToolCaller processes a request:
```python
# Initialize the ToolCaller with a specific sampler
toolcaller = ToolCaller(
    # Choose either LiteLLMSampler for cloud models or VLLMSampler for local models
    sampler=LiteLLMSampler(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"),  # or VLLMSampler(model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B")
    # Specify which Python packages can be imported in the execution environment
    authorized_imports=["pandas", "numpy"]
)

# Define tools
tools = [StockPriceTool(cutoff_date="2024-03-20")]

# Generate responses
async for output in toolcaller.generate(
    system_prompt="You are an expert assistant. Available tools: {tool_desc}",
    user_prompt="What was Apple's stock price last week?",
    tools=tools
):
    # Output can be:
    # 1. Model's text response (generated by the sampler)
    # 2. Tool execution results
    # 3. Code block execution logs
    print(output, end="")
```

The ToolCaller handles several key aspects:
- **Model Integration**: Delegates model inference to the provided sampler
- **Tool Registration**: Automatically registers tools and generates their descriptions
- **Code Execution**: Manages a secure Python environment for executing code blocks
- **Streaming**: Provides streaming responses for both model outputs and tool results
- **Error Handling**: Captures and reports errors from both model and tool execution
- **State Management**: Maintains conversation history and execution state

### Samplers

DeepReasoningTools provides an abstract sampler interface and two concrete implementations:

1. **AbstractSampler**: Base class defining the sampling interface
2. **LiteLLMSampler**: Integration with LiteLLM for various model providers
3. **VLLMSampler**: High-performance inference using vLLM

The samplers expect messages to follow the OpenAI chat completion format, where each message is a dictionary with:
- `role`: One of "system", "user", or "assistant"
- `content`: The message content as a string

Example message format:
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me check that for you..."}
]
```

To create a custom sampler:

```python
from deepreasoningwithtools.samplers.abstract import AbstractSampler
from typing import AsyncGenerator

class CustomSampler(AbstractSampler):
    async def sample(self, messages: list[dict[str, str]]) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
        # messages will be a list of dictionaries following the OpenAI format
        # Implement your sampling logic here
        yield "response"
```

### Tools

Tools are implemented using the `Tool` class from smolagents. Each tool must define:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `description`: Documentation of the tool's purpose
- `inputs`: Dictionary of input parameters and their types
- `output_type`: Type of the tool's output
- `forward()`: Implementation of the tool's functionality

Example tool implementation:

```python
from smolagents import Tool

class CustomTool(Tool):
    name = "custom_tool"
    description = "Description of what the tool does"
    inputs = {
        "param1": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Description of param1"
        }
    }
    output_type = "object"

    def forward(self, param1: str):
        # Implement tool logic here
        return result
```

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. Implement your tool class inheriting from `Tool`
2. Define the required attributes (name, description, inputs, output_type)
3. Implement the `forward()` method
4. Import and use your tool with the `ToolCaller`

Example:

```python
from smolagents import Tool

class MyCustomTool(Tool):
    name = "my_custom_tool"
    description = "A custom tool that does something useful"
    inputs = {
        "input_param": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Input parameter description"
        }
    }
    output_type = "object"

    def forward(self, input_param: str):
        # Tool implementation
        return {"result": f"Processed {input_param}"}
```

## Authorized Imports

The `ToolCaller` allows you to specify which Python packages can be imported in the execution environment. This provides security and control over what code can be executed.

```python
toolcaller = ToolCaller(
    sampler=LiteLLMSampler(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    authorized_imports=["pandas", "numpy", "requests"]
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Design**:
   - Keep tools focused and single-purpose
   - Provide clear descriptions and parameter documentation
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Use type hints for better code clarity

2. **Security**:
   - Only authorize necessary imports
   - Validate tool inputs
   - Implement appropriate access controls
   - Use cutoff dates for time-sensitive data

3. **Performance**:
   - Use streaming for long-running operations
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Consider using vLLM for high-performance inference

## Example output:
**Query:** Compare Tesla and Microsoft's financial performance over the last quarter

**Response:**
Okay, let's tackle the user's request to compare Tesla and Microsoft's financial performance over the last quarter. First, I need to figure out which financial metrics to use. Typically, revenue, net income, gross margin, and maybe earnings per share (EPS) are key indicators. 

Wait, the user mentioned "last quarter," so I should get the quarterly financial statements for both companies. The company_financials tool can fetch income statements, balance sheets, or cash flow statements. Since we're looking at financial performance, the income statement is the right choice here. So statement_type should be 'income' and period 'quarterly'.

I'll need to call company_financials for both Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT), specifying the income statement and quarterly period. But I should get the latest available quarterly data. Let me structure the code to fetch their quarterly income statements.

Once I have the dataframes, I'll need to extract the latest quarter's data. The data might have multiple quarters, so I have to look for the most recent one. Also, since fiscal years might differ between companies, I should sort the data by the date and pick the latest.

After fetching the data, I'll compare key metrics like total revenue, net income, gross profit, and maybe margins. Calculations like gross margin percentage can be useful for comparison. 

Wait, there's also the stock price to consider. The user might want to see recent stock performance alongside the financials. To get the latest stock price, I can use the stock_price tool with today's date (or the latest available data). But since it's historical data, the end date should be the most recent business day. The user mentioned "last quarter," so getting the latest closing price could add context about market reception.

Putting it all together:

1. Fetch quarterly income statements for TSLA and MSFT using company_financials.
2. Extract the latest quarter's data for each.
3. Extract metrics: revenue, net income, gross profit, EPS.
4. Calculate margins percentages.
5. Get latest stock prices to see market response.
6. Present the comparison in a clear manner.

Wait, possible issues? The income statements might come with time periods described differently, like "2023-06-30" as of June 30, 2023. Need to parse the dates and ensure we pick the same quarter for both. But if their fiscal quarters don't align exactly, how should I handle that? Hmm, maybe default to the most recent quarter regardless. 

Also, ensuring the data parses correctly into DataFrame objects. The start and end dates for the stock price would be recent, like the last few days.

I should write code that fetches the financials, then process each DataFrame to get the latest quarter, then do the calculations and comparisons. Then do the stock price check. 

Let me start writing the code step by step. First, get Tesla's financials:

Use `company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly')`. Same for MSFT. Then, process each result. The index might have dates, so `.iloc[0]` gives the latest. 

Wait, checking for possible errors: if the data isn't available because it's beyond the cutoff, but assuming the user's data is accessible.

After getting the numbers, I can compute gross margin as (Gross Profit / Revenue)*100. Then present the comparison in the answer, perhaps in bullet points or a table-like structure.

Stock prices: Using stock_price for each ticker with recent dates, say start_date as today minus 30 days, end_date today, interval '1d', then take the last closing price.

Putting all together, in code:

Fetch Tesla's quarterly income statement, get latest Quarter's revenue, net income, etc.

Same for Microsoft.

Then stock prices.

Then, compile the numbers. Then write the answer comparing them based on the metrics and stock price.

```python
# Fetch quarterly income statements for Tesla and Microsoft
tesla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly')
microsoft_income = company_financials('MSFT', 'income', 'quarterly')

# Extract the most recent quarter's data for each company
tesla_q = tesla_income.iloc[0]
microsoft_q = microsoft_income.iloc[0]

# Get latest stock prices
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
end_date = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=1)
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

tesla_price = stock_price('TSLA', start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), '1d')['Close'][-1]
microsoft_price = stock_price('MSFT', start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), '1d')['Close'][-1]

# Calculate key metrics
metrics = {
    'Metric': ['Revenue', 'Net Income', 'Gross Profit', 'Gross Margin (%)', 'Closing Stock Price'],
    'Tesla': [
        tesla_q['Total Revenue'],

        tesla_q['Gross Profit'],

        tesla_price
    ],
    'Microsoft': [
        microsoft_q['Total Revenue'],
        microsoft_q['Net Income'],

        microsoft_price
    ],
    'Difference %': [
        ((microsoft_q['Total Revenue'] - tesla_q['Total Revenue']) / tesla_q['Total Revenue']) * 100,
        ((microsoft_q['Net Income'] - tesla_q['Net Income']) / tesla_q['Net Income']) * 100,
        ((microsoft_q['Gross Profit'] - tesla_q['Gross Profit']) / tesla_q['Gross Profit']) * 100,
        ((microsoft_q['Gross Profit']/microsoft_q['Total Revenue'] - tesla_q['Gross Profit']/tesla_q['Total Revenue']) / (tesla_q['Gross Profit']/tesla_q['Total Revenue'])) * 100,
        ((microsoft_price - tesla_price) / tesla_price) * 100
    ]
}
