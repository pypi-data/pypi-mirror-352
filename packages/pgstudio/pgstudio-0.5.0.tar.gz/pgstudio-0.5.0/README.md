...

if e.type == pygame_gui.UI_BUTTON_PRESSED and e.ui_element == elements['<button_id>']:
    script_<button_id>.run(elements['<button_id>'], event=e)
```

In `scripts/MyScript.py`:

```python
def run(obj, event=None):
    # Do something with the clicked button
```

## ‚ùó Error Dialogs

* Any failure‚Äîdrawing, file I/O, invalid user actions‚Äîtriggers a `UIMessageWindow` with a descriptive message.
