## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-04

### Added
- New `@ensure_date` decorator to automatically default `from_date` to `today` if `None`.
- `next_weekday()` function to compute the next occurrence of a given weekday.
- Convenience functions: `next_monday()`, `next_tuesday()`, ..., `next_sunday()`.
- `prev_weekday()` function to compute the previous occurrence of a given weekday.
- Convenience functions: `prev_monday()`, `prev_tuesday()`, ..., `prev_sunday()`.
- Full unit test coverage for all weekday-related functions.
- Improved docstrings across all core functions and decorators.

### Changed
- Updated `__init__.py` to expose all new weekday functions and the `Day` enum via `__all__`.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-05-30

### Changed
- Renamed project from `timecraft` to `timecraftx` due to namespace conflict on PyPI.
