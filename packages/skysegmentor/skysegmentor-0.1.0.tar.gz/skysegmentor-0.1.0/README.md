## Introduction

**SkySegmentor** is a ``python`` package for dividing points or maps (in ``HEALPix``
format) on the celestial sphere into equal-sized segments. It employs a sequential 
binary space partitioning scheme -- a generalization of the *k*-d tree algorithm -- 
that supports segmentation of arbitrarily shaped sky regions. By design, all 
partitions are approximately equal in area, with discrepancies no larger than the 
``HEALPix`` pixel scale.

## Dependencies

* `numpy>=1.22,<1.27`
* `healpy>=1.15.0`

## Installation

First clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/SkySegmentor.git
cd SkySegmentor
```

and install by running

```
pip install . [--user]
```

You should now be able to import the module:

```python
import skysegmentor
```

## Documentation

Documentation, including tutorials and explanation of API, can be found here ``https://skysegmentor.readthedocs.io/``. Alternatively a PDF version of the documentation is located in the ``docs/`` folder called ``skysegmentor.pdf``. Offline documentation can be generating by running ``make html`` in the ``docs/`` folder which will generate html documentation in the ``docs/build/html`` folder that can be accessed by opening the ``index.html`` file in a browser.

## Tutorial

### Basic Usage

#### Segmenting Healpix Maps

```python
import healpy
import skysegmentor

# Healpix mask, where zeros are regions outside of the mask and ones inside the
# mask. You can also input a weighted map, where instead of 1s you give weights.
mask = # define mask values

Npartitions = 100 # Number of partitions
partitionmap = skysegmentor.segmentmapN(mask, Npartitions)
```

#### Segmenting Points on the Sphere

```python
import skysegmentor

# Define points on the sphere to be segmented.
phi = # longitude defined in radians from [0, 2*pi]
the = # latitude defined in radians from [0, pi], where 0 = North Pole.

Npartitions = 100 # Number of partitions
partitionIDs = skysegmentor.segmentpointsN(phi, the, Npartitions)
```

if using RA and Dec in degrees you can convert to phi and the using

```python
phi = np.deg2rad(ra)
the = np.deg2rad(90. - dec)
```

if not all points are equal, you can specify a weight

```python
weights = # define point weights
partitionIDs = skysegmentor.segmentpointsN(phi, the, Npartitions, weights=weights)
```
