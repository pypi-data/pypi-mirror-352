# HeWo PyGame
In the beginning, HeWo's face was a rudimentary prototype in pygame.
I saw potential in how we can manipulate the surfaces using pygame,
and I love algebra, so I began designing a geometric face for HeWo.

`hewo_pygame` is a package that implements the logic for HeWo's window system,
face, and multimedia displayer. It also contains the objects that can be controlled
in the window.

## Installation
To install and run the package, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install hewo
```
Then you can run the package using the following command:
```bash
hewo_main
```

## Control Interface
### Keyboard
### API server
Flask (Only receives POST requests)
