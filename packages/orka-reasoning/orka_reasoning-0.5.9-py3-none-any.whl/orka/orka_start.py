"""
OrKa Service Runner
==================

This module provides functionality to start and manage the OrKa infrastructure services.
It handles the initialization and lifecycle of Redis and the OrKa backend server,
ensuring they are properly configured and running before allowing user workflows
to execute.

Key Features:
-----------
1. Infrastructure Management: Automates the startup and shutdown of required services
2. Docker Integration: Manages Redis containers via Docker Compose
3. Process Management: Starts and monitors the OrKa backend server process
4. Graceful Shutdown: Ensures clean teardown of services on exit
5. Path Discovery: Locates configuration files in development and production environments

This module serves as the main entry point for running the complete OrKa service stack.
It can be executed directly to start all necessary services:

```bash
python -m orka.orka_start
```

Once started, the services will run until interrupted (e.g., Ctrl+C), at which point
they will be gracefully shut down.
