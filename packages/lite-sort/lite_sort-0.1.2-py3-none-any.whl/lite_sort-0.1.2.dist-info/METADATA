# lite-sort
`lite-sort` is a simple program to collect and sort files in a given directory into directories
matching (or relevant to) their filetype. Filetype is typically determined by the file's extension,
but falls back to using file header to resolve files without extensions. Written with Python3+

## Install (may require a venv)
$ pip install lite-sort

## Examples
```console
$ lite-sort file1.txt file2.pdf file3.zip
~/Documents
 \_ txt/
 \_ pdf/
 \_ zip/
```

```
Usage: lite-sort [options] [files]

With no files provided, sorts files starting from the current directory and its subdirectories.

                            list will be merged with the [files] passed as arguments
-h, --help                  display this help and exit
