# ✨ Welcome to CosmoTalker v1.9 - Your Gateway to the Cosmos!

🚀 **CosmoTalker v1.8.7** is here! Explore space and science effortlessly with this offline Python library, now with a **beta image preview tool**, **enhanced data library**, **improved deep search algorithm**, **better response accuracy**, and **new cosmic event tracking**!

## 🌠 About CosmoTalker

Developed by **Bhuvanesh M**, CosmoTalker is a Python library that brings knowledge of celestial bodies, scientific phenomena, and space-related information directly to your system—no internet required for core data! However, enhanced search, real-time space updates, and news require an internet connection.

## ✨ Features:

✅ Chat with the **Cosmic Bot** using `cosmotalker.chat()` 🤖🌌
✅ Get detailed information about celestial bodies within the **Solar System** 🌍☀️ &#x20;
✅ Learn about various scientific phenomena 🔬 &#x20;
✅ Ask space and science-related questions for insightful responses 🧩 &#x20;
✅ Works **offline** with an optimized Python module 🖥️🚀 &#x20;
✅ Optional **online** features for enhanced exploration 🌌

📍 **Note:** CosmoTalker v1.0 focused on the **Solar System**. Future updates will expand its capabilities to explore galaxies and beyond! ✨

## 🌍 Contribute to a Greener Planet!

The `cosmotalker.search(str)` function in the Python library (since v1.1.1), supports a greener Earth by using the Ecosia search engine 🌱💚. Every search helps plant trees and contribute to reforestation 🌳. This function requires a string input and performs an online search.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### Installation:

```sh
pip install cosmotalker
```

### Basic Usage:

```python
import cosmotalker

# 💬 Chatbot
print(cosmotalker.chat())

# Retrieve information about a celestial body
earth_info = cosmotalker.get("earth")
print(earth_info)  # Offline function

# Provide feedback to improve CosmoTalker
print(cosmotalker.feedback())

# Online Features
print(cosmotalker.apod())          # Fetch Astronomy Picture of the Day
print(cosmotalker.celestrak())     # Get satellite tracking data
print(cosmotalker.search("yt"))    # Opens YouTube
print(cosmotalker.search("words")) # Eco-friendly web search
print(cosmotalker.get("yuri"))     # Deep search about Yuri
print(cosmotalker.spacex())        # SpaceX upcoming launches
print(cosmotalker.wiki("black hole"))  # New wiki summary (v1.6)

# 📸 New in v1.8.7: Image Function (Beta)
print(cosmotalker.img())           # Preview and download cosmic images (Beta)
```

📌 **Note:** In `cosmotalker.search()`, you can use shortcuts like `wa` for WhatsApp, `fb` for Facebook, `insta` for Instagram, `gpt` for ChatGPT, etc., or provide a query to perform an online search.

💇 **For Online Features:**
Future updates about **SpaceX** will be available through `cosmotalker.spacex()` 🚀.

### 🔍 New in v1.6: `cosmotalker.wiki()`

Now includes Wikipedia integration! Fetch high-quality summaries from Wikipedia and measure how fast it was retrieved:

```python
print(cosmotalker.wiki("black hole"))
```

**Output Sample:**

```
Summary fetched in 0.4843580722808838 seconds

Summary:
A black hole is a massive, compact astronomical object so dense that its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light...
```
