- report_kwargs()
- validate_kwargs()
- validate_expected()
- limit_kwargs()

Private functions used for validating the arguments passed
to the major functions as **kwargs keyword arguments.  This
allows us to warn when an unexpected argument appears or
when the value is not of the expected type.

This module is not intended to be used directly by the user.

The assumption is that most keyword arguments are one of the
following types:
- simple types (such as str, int, float, bool, complex, NoneType)
- Sequences (such as list, tuple, but excluding strings, and without
  being infinitely recursive, like a list of lists of lists ...)
- Sets (such as set, frozenset)
- Mappings (such as dict)

Note: this means some Python types are only partially supported.
Others are unsupported, such as: generators, iterators, and
coroutines.

In  order to check the **kwargs dictionary, we need to construct
a dictionary of expected keywords and their expected types.
An example follows.

expected = {
    "arg1": str,  # arg1 is expected to be a string
    "arg2": (int, float),  # arg2 is an int or a float
    "arg3": (list, (bool,)), # arg3 is a list of Booleans
    "arg4": (list, (float, int)), # arg4 is a list of floats or ints
    "arg5": (Sequence, (float, int)), # a sequence of floats or ints
    "arg6": (dict, (str, int)), # a dictionary with str keys and int values
)

Parsing Rules:
- If the type is a single type, it is used as is.
- if the type is a tuple of simple types, it is treated as a union.
- if the type of non-String Sequence, the subsequent tuple is a
  union of Sequence member types.
  - eg, (list, (float, int)) is a list of floats or ints.
  - eg, (int, float, list, (int, float)) is an int, a float or
        a list of ints or floats.
- if the type of a Mapping, the subsequent 2-part tuple is treated
  as the types of the keys and values of the Mapping.
  - eg, (dict, (str, int)) is a dictionary with str keys and int values.
  - eg, (dict, (str, (int, float))) is a dictionary with str keys and
        an int or float values.
  - eg, (dict, (str, list, (int, float)), (list, (int, float))) is a
        dictionary with str keys and a list of ints or floats as values.
- Sets are treated like Sequences.

Limitations:
- cannot specify multiple types of Sequence as a type - for example
    ((list, tuple), int) - but you can specify (Sequence, int) which
    will match list and tuple types. or you might do it as follows:
    (list, (int, float), tuple, (int, float)).
- strings, bytearrays, bytes are treated as simple types, not Sequences.
- You cannot use generators or iterators as types, they would be
    consumed in the testing.
- Sequence, Set and Mapping must be imported from collections.abc
    and not from the older typing module. A world of pain awaits
    if you do.
