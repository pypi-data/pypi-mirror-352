# 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixed Deprecated Actions

The following deprecated GitHub Actions have been updated to their latest versions:

### Updated Actions
- `actions/setup-python@v4` → `actions/setup-python@v5`
- `actions/cache@v3` → `actions/cache@v4` 
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2` → Removed (not needed with peaceiris action)
- `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` → `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`

### Two Workflow Options Available

#### 1. Simple Workflow (`docs.yml`) ⭐ **Recommended**
- Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` for deployment
- Simple setup: GitHub Pages source = "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages"  
- Reliable and widely used approach

#### 2. Native GitHub Pages (`deploy-docs.yml`)
- Uses GitHub's official `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- Modern approach with proper permissions
- Setup: GitHub Pages source = "GitHub Actions"
- Includes build/deploy job separation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### For Simple Workflow (Recommended)
1. **GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Repository → Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages" 
   - Save

2. **Permissions:**
   - Settings → Actions → General
   - Workflow permissions: "Read and write permissions"
   - ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests

### For Native GitHub Pages
1. **GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Repository → Settings → Pages  
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - No branch selection needed

2. **Permissions:**
   - Already configured in workflow with proper permissions

## 🧪 Validation

Both workflows have been validated:
- ✅ YAML syntax correct
- ✅ All actions use latest versions
- ✅ No deprecated dependencies
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Build optimization with caching

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Choose workflow:** Keep `docs.yml` or switch to `deploy-docs.yml`
2. **Delete unused workflow** to avoid confusion
3. **Configure GitHub Pages** according to chosen workflow
4. **Push changes** to trigger automatic deployment

Your documentation will be deployed to: `https://username.github.io/mmpp/`

## 🔍 Key Improvements

- **No more deprecation warnings**
- **Faster builds** with dependency caching
- **Better error handling** with `--keep-going`
- **Proper permissions** configuration
- **Modern GitHub Actions** patterns
- **Comprehensive documentation** setup guide

The workflows are now **future-proof** and use **current best practices**! 🎯
