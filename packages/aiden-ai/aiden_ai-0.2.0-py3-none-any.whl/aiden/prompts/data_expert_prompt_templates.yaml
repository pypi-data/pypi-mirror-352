    Write the requested solution plans for the Data Engineering problem outlined above. The solution should be
    a plan to solve the Data Engineering problem outlined above.
    If the task description does not specify the data transformation desired behaviour, input/output schemas,
    or the LLM to use for plan generation, you should reject the task and ask your manager to provide the required
    information.

    The solution concepts should be explained in 3-5 sentences each. Do not include implementations of the
    solutions, though you can include small code snippets if absolutely required to explain a plan.
    The solutions should be feasible using only 
    {{allowed_packages}}, and no other non-standard libraries.
    
    For THE solution, your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
    ### 1. Solution Plan 'Headline' (short version):
    ### 2. Solution Plan (detailed version):

    Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
    And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.
