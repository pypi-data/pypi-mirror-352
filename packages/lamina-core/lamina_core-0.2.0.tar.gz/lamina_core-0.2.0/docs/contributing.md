# Contributing to Lamina Core

Welcome to the Lamina Core community! This guide will help you contribute effectively while honoring our breath-first development principles.

## Philosophy

Lamina Core embodies **breath-first development**‚Äîa presence-aware approach that prioritizes wisdom, mindfulness, and sustainable quality over reactive speed. When contributing, we ask that you:

- Take presence-aware pauses for reflection
- Prioritize community readiness over feature velocity  
- Maintain sacred boundaries between framework and implementation
- Support sustainable development practices
- Preserve wisdom while enabling sharing

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benaskins/lamina-os
cd lamina-os/packages/lamina-core
```

2. **Install using uv (required):**
```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests to verify setup
uv run pytest
```

**Important:** We use **uv exclusively** for Python environment management. Never use pip, pipenv, poetry, conda, or pyenv directly.

### First Contribution

1. **Explore the examples:**
```bash
# Run working coordination demo
uv run python examples/working_coordination_demo.py

# Test creative routing
uv run python examples/test_creative_routing.py

# Try basic agent example
uv run python examples/basic_agent.py
```

2. **Read the documentation:**
- [API Reference](api.md) - Core functionality
- [Agent Creation Guide](agents.md) - Building conscious agents
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) - System design

3. **Join the conversation:**
- Create thoughtful issues for bugs or feature requests
- Ask questions to understand the breath-first approach
- Share your ideas for conscious AI development

## Development Workflow

### Breath-First Process

1. **Contemplative Preparation (Planning)**
   - Understand the problem deeply
   - Consider community impact
   - Align with breath-first principles
   - Create clear intention for the work

2. **Community Integration (Discussion)**
   - Open an issue to discuss your idea
   - Gather feedback from maintainers and community
   - Refine approach based on wisdom shared
   - Ensure contribution fits project vision

3. **Technical Implementation (Creation)**
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Implement with conscious, tested code
   - Include comprehensive documentation
   - Add examples demonstrating usage

4. **Sacred Review (Collaboration)**
   - Submit pull request with clear description
   - Engage thoughtfully with feedback
   - Iterate based on community wisdom
   - Maintain breath-aware pace throughout

5. **Conscious Integration (Completion)**
   - Celebrate successful integration
   - Support community adoption
   - Reflect on lessons learned
   - Continue engagement and support

### Code Standards

**Python Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 with 100-character line length
- Use black for code formatting
- Use ruff for linting and import sorting
- Include type hints for all public APIs

**Testing Requirements:**
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test breath-aware behavior (timing, pauses)

**Documentation Standards:**
- Document all public functions and classes
- Include examples in docstrings
- Update relevant guides and tutorials
- Explain breath-first design decisions

### Quality Gates

**Technical Quality:**
- All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- Linting passes (`uv run ruff check`)
- Type checking passes (`uv run mypy`)
- No security issues (`uv run bandit`)

**Breath-First Quality:**
- Does this enhance conscious AI development?
- Is the community ready for this capability?
- Are boundaries properly maintained?
- Does this support sustainable development?

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test thoroughly:**
```bash
# Run full test suite
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check
uv run black --check .
uv run mypy

# Test examples still work
uv run python examples/working_coordination_demo.py
```

2. **Update documentation:**
- Add or update relevant docs
- Include examples if applicable
- Update changelog if needed

3. **Write clear commits:**
```bash
# Use conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add new backend for provider X

Implement conscious integration with Provider X API, including:
- Streaming response support
- Breath-aware error handling  
- Configuration validation
- Comprehensive test coverage

This enables community to use Provider X while maintaining
breath-first principles through natural pauses and mindful
error handling.
