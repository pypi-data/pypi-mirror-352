 # Codexium

A tool to auto-generate a professional README for your project.

## Installation

To install Codexium, use pip:

```bash
pip install codexium
```

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
codexium .
```

Replace `.` with the path to your project folder if it's not in the current directory.

Codexium will scan for relevant files, compile them into a format suitable for a README, and then prompt an AI model to generate a comprehensive and well-written README.md file for you. The resulting file will be saved in the root of your project folder.

## Development

You can make changes to the code and test it locally by running:

```bash
python -m codexium .
```
