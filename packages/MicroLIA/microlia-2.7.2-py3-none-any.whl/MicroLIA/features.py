    Shannon entropy (Shannon et al. 1949) is used as a metric to quantify the amount of
    information carried by a signal. The procedure employed here follows that outlined by
    (D. Mislis et al. 2015). The probability of each point is given by a Cumulative Distribution
    Function (CDF). Following the same procedure as (D. Mislis et al. 2015), this function employs
    both the normal and inversed gaussian CDF, with the total shannon entropy given by a combination of
    the two. See: (SIDRA: a blind algorithm for signal detection in photometric surveys, D. Mislis et al., 2015)

    Gskew is a measure of the skewness of a distribution of magnitudes. It is defined as the 
    sum of the medians of the magnitudes below and above the 3rd and 97th percentiles, respectively, 
    minus twice the median magnitude. In other words, Gskew is a measure of the asymmetry of the 
    distribution of magnitudes. A positive Gskew value indicates a distribution that is skewed to the 
    right (has a long tail on the right side), while a negative Gskew value indicates a distribution 
    that is skewed to the left (has a long tail on the left side).

    It is essentially a median-based measure of the skewness. See: Lopez et al. 2016: "A machine learned classifier for RR Lyrae in the VVV survey" 

    Gskew = mq3 + mq97 â 2m
    mq3 is the median of magnitudes lesser or equal than the quantile 3.
    mq97 is the median of magnitudes greater or equal than the quantile 97.
    2m is 2 times the median magnitude.

    If apply_weights=True a modified version will be used that incorporates the photometric 
    errors of the data points. It calculates a weighted median for the magnitudes that 
    fall below the 3rd percentile and above the 97th percentile, using the inverse 
    square of the photometric errors as weights. The resulting weighted medians and 
    the median magnitude are then used to calculate the Gskew value.

    In the case where weights are applied, the magnitudes are multiplied by their corresponding 
    weights (inverse square of photometric errors) before squaring and summing them. This results in 
    a larger contribution from data points with smaller errors, as they receive higher weights. As a result, 
    the absolute energy value increases. On the other hand, when weights are not applied (apply_weights=False), 
    all magnitudes are squared and summed without considering their errors. This leads to a smaller 
    absolute energy value as the contributions from individual data points are not scaled by their respective errors.

    The C3 measure is a way to estimate the non-linearity of a time series by measuring the third-order 
    correlation between the values of the time series. It is based on the idea that a truly linear time 
    series will have a third-order correlation of zero, while a non-linear time series will have a 
    non-zero third-order correlation. The lag parameter controls the distance between the three values 
    of the time series that are used to calculate the third-order correlation. A larger lag value will 
    capture longer-term correlations in the data, while a smaller lag value will capture shorter-term correlations.
    
    In this updated version, we first calculate the terms that make up the third-order correlation using the 
    mag array and its two rolled versions. We then use the error propagation formula to calculate the errors associated 
    with these terms. Finally, we calculate the third-order correlation as the weighted average of the terms, where the 
    weights are given by the inverse squared errors. Note that this version of the function assumes Gaussian errors in the magerr array.

            The timestamps of the corresponding mag and magerr measurements. Must be an array.
        mag : array
            The time-varying intensity of the lightcurve. Must be an array.
        magerr : array
            Photometric error for the intensity. Must be an array.
        r : float
            The percentage of the range to compare with. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.75.
        apply_weights : bool, optional
            Whether to apply weights based on the magnitude errors. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
    ------- 
    float    
        The 75th quantile of the ordered lightcurve measurements.
