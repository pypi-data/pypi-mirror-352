1.0.1 (2023-10-17)
==================
- Bug fix: Negative declinations resulted in the GTVT throwing an
  error because the argument parser accepts arguments that start with
  '--' and '-', so was unable to interpret the minus sign. Updates to
  the jwst_gtvt call were implemented to get around this issue by
  requiring '--ra=' and '--dec=' in front of the right ascension and
  declination values, respectively. The README was updated with this information.
