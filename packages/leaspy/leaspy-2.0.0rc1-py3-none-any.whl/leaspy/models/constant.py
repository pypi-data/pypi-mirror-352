class ConstantModel(GenericModel):
    r"""
    `ConstantModel` is a benchmark model that predicts constant values (no matter what the patient's ages are).

    These constant values depend on the algorithm setting and the patient's values
    provided during :term:`calibration`.

    It could predict:
        * ``last``: last value seen during calibration (even if ``NaN``).
        * ``last_known``: last non ``NaN`` value seen during :term:`calibration`.
        * ``max``: maximum (=worst) value seen during :term:`calibration`.
        * ``mean``: average of values seen during :term:`calibration`.

    .. warning::
        Depending on ``features``, the ``last_known`` / ``max`` value
        may correspond to different visits.

    .. warning::
        For a given feature, value will be ``NaN`` if and only if all
        values for this feature were ``NaN``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : :obj:`str`
        The model's name.
    **kwargs
        Hyperparameters for the model.
        None supported for now.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : :obj:`str`
        The model's name.
    is_initialized : :obj:`bool`
        Always ``True`` (no true initialization needed for constant model).
    features : :obj:`list` of :obj:`str`
        List of the model features.
        Unlike most models features will be determined at :term:`personalization`
        only (because it does not needed any `fit`).
    dimension : :obj:`int`
        Number of features (read-only).
    parameters : :obj:`dict`
        The model has no parameters: empty dictionary.
        The ``prediction_type`` parameter should be defined during
        :term:`personalization`.
        Example:
            >>> AlgorithmSettings('constant_prediction', prediction_type='last_known')
