Extended ``django-stubs``
=========================

This is an extension on the `django-stubs`_ project that makes it possible to
represent all concrete descendants of an abstract Django ORM Model in terms of
those abstract models.

The intention is to get this code working and tested and documented before
getting those changes into the ``django-stubs`` project itself.

History
-------

This project comes from working on a large Django project (millions of lines of
code) that has varying levels of typing maturity within it. In working towards
getting that project onto the latest version of ``mypy`` and ``django-stubs``
there twere 100s of errors that appeared due to ``mypy`` correctly complaining
about abstract model types not having on them properties that are only on their
concrete descendants. This project was created to resolve this issue without
simply ignoring the problem.
