A plugin for foreground vegetation segmentation, tailored for trellised vegetation row images. It uses RGB images to perform inference and allows users to manually refine the generated mask.

----------------------------------

The method was developped by Herearii Metuarea, PHENET PhD at LARIS (French laboratory located in Angers, France) and Abdoul Djalil Ousseini Hamza, AgroEcoPhen Engineer at IRHS (French Institute located in INRAe Angers, France) in Imhorphen team (bioimaging research group lead) under the supervision of Eric DuchÃªne (Research Engineer), Morgane Roth (Research Engineer) and David Rousseau (Full professor). This plugin was written by Herearii Metuarea and was designed in the context of the european project PHENET.

-->

## Installation

You can install `frontveg` via [pip]:

    pip install frontveg

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/frontveg.git

GPU is mandatory for time processing and models running (especially Grounding-DINO). Please visit the official PyTorch website to get the appropriate installation command: ðŸ‘‰ https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally

**Exemple : GPU (CUDA 12.1)**

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

## Description

This plugin is a tool to perform image inference. This plugin contained two steps of image processing. First, from RGB image, a depth map is estimated and then thresholded based on the estimated depth histogram modes to detect foreground and background regions in image. Second, a Grounding DINO model detects foliage in the foreground. The output is a binary mask where white colour are associated to foliage in the foreground.

The plugin is applicable to images of trellised plants; in this configuration, it has been applied to images of pome fruit trees (apple), stone fruit trees (apricot) and climbing plants (grapevine).
