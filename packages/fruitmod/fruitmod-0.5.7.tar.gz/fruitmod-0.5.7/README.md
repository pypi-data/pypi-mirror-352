fruitmod Library

This library provides a collection of utility functions for performing various mathematical and numerical operations.
Each function is named after a fruit, and the functionality varies from basic arithmetic to more complex operations.

Functions:

1. sib(n):

   - Calculates the factorial of a given number `n`.

2. golabi(a, b):

   - Computes the sum of all integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive).

3. tameshk(a, b):

   - Returns the larger of the two numbers `a` and `b`.

4. porteghal(n):

   - Finds the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.

5. talebi(n):

   - Counts the number of digits in the integer `n`.

6. havij(n):

   - Reverses the digits of the integer `n`.

7. kivi(n):

   - Checks if `n` is a perfect number (sum of divisors excluding itself equals `n`).
   - Returns "yes" if perfect, otherwise "no".

8. khiar(n):

   - Checks if `n` is a prime number.
   - Returns "yes" if prime, otherwise "no".

9. holoo(a, b):

   - Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

10. ananas(n):

    - Generates the nth Fibonacci number.

11. aloo(n, a):

    - Counts the occurrences of the digit `a` in the number `n`.

12. moz(n):

    - Counts the number of divisors of `n`.

13. anar(n):

    - Returns the absolute value of `n`.

14. angoor(n):

    - Prints each digit of `n` on a new line.

15. albaloo(a, b):
    - Prints all integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive).

Note:

- The library assumes that inputs are integers and does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly.
- Some functions print results directly, while others return values.
