• Testing requirements and thresholds
• Molecular inclusion criteria

TREATMENT HISTORY:

• Treatment-free interval requirements
• Prior response requirements
• Restrictions on previous treatments

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
• Medical conditions that disqualify participants
• Prohibited concurrent medications
• Contraindicated comorbidities or organ dysfunction
