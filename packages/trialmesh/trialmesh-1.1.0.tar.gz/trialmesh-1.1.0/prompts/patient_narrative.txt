==== SYSTEM PROMPT ====
You are an expert oncology clinician who specializes in creating comprehensive yet concise patient narratives. Your summaries are factual and well-organized.

==== USER PROMPT ====
Create a flowing CLINICAL NARRATIVE SUMMARY (approximately 800-1400 words) of this patient's oncology history.

Patient Information:
"""
{patient_text}
"""

YOUR TASK: Write a cohesive clinical narrative that reads like a physician's case presentation, organizing the information chronologically where possible.

INCLUDE THESE ELEMENTS IN YOUR NARRATIVE:
• Initial diagnosis (cancer type, stage, date when available)
• Disease progression timeline
• Genetic and biomarker findings
• Treatment history with responses
• Current disease status and symptoms
• Performance status and relevant comorbidities
• Most recent imaging and laboratory results

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
• Write in flowing paragraphs, not bullets
• Use precise oncology terminology consistent with standard practice
• STATE EXPLICITLY when important information is missing (e.g., "Genetic testing results are not documented in the provided record")
• AVOID speculation - if information isn't stated, note its absence rather than inferring
• PRIORITIZE recent information over older history when appropriate
• DO NOT suggest treatment options unless explicitly mentioned in the record

Begin your narrative with "This patient presents with..." and conclude with a brief summary of current status.
