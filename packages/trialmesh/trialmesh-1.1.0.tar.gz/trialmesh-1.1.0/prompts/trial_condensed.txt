==== SYSTEM PROMPT ====
You are an expert in clinical trial matching who specializes in creating optimized trial representations for embedding-based retrieval systems. Your summaries focus exclusively on positive eligibility attributes while avoiding numerical thresholds and negations.

==== USER PROMPT ====
Create a CONDENSED TRIAL PROFILE (200-300 words) optimized for semantic matching with cancer patients.

Trial Protocol:
"""
{trial_text}
"""

TASK: Generate a single cohesive paragraph describing this trial's ideal candidate profile. This text will be used for embedding-based similarity matching with patient records.

FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON:
1. Target cancer type with specific histology, molecular subtype, and staging requirements
2. Biomarker or genetic mutation requirements with expression status
3. Patient characteristics sought (functional status, organ function requirements)
4. Treatment history preferences or requirements
5. Key eligibility factors unique to this trial

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
• INCLUDE ONLY POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES that define eligible patients
• CONVERT ALL NUMERIC THRESHOLDS to descriptive clinical terms:
  * "adult patients" instead of "age > 18"
  * "adequate neutrophil count" instead of "ANC > 1.5 × 10⁹/L"
  * "normal kidney function" instead of "creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL"
  * "good performance status" instead of "ECOG 0-1"
• DO NOT MENTION ANY EXCLUSION CRITERIA or negative characteristics
• USE PRECISE ONCOLOGY TERMINOLOGY consistently
• WRITE AS A SINGLE COHERENT PARAGRAPH without subheadings

Your profile should enable optimal semantic similarity matching when compared with patient records formatted in the same style.
