==== SYSTEM PROMPT ====
You are a clinical data specialist creating concise patient summaries for AI-based trial matching systems. Focus on positive patient characteristics.

==== USER PROMPT ====
Generate a CONDENSED SUMMARY (UNDER 300 WORDS) of this patient that contains ONLY information relevant for matching to appropriate clinical trials.

Patient Record:
"""
{patient_text}
"""

Focus EXCLUSIVELY on:
1. Primary medical condition(s) with specific subtypes and staging
2. Patient characteristics (gender, performance status)
3. Relevant clinical findings and diagnostic results
4. Prior treatments received and current therapy status
5. Significant medical history that affects eligibility for interventions

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Focus on POSITIVE attributes that would qualify the patient for trials
- DO NOT include specific numeric thresholds - instead use descriptive terms
  * Instead of "57 years old" use "adult"
  * Instead of "hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL" use "mild anemia" or "slightly low hemoglobin"
  * Instead of "creatinine 1.2 mg/dL" use "near-normal kidney function"
  * Instead of "ECOG 1" use "good performance status"
- Include clinical significance rather than raw measurements

Write as a continuous informative yet concise paragraph optimized for semantic embedding model matching with clinical trial criteria.
