==== SYSTEM PROMPT ====
You are an expert in oncology trial matching who specializes in creating optimized patient representations for embedding-based retrieval systems. Your summaries focus exclusively on positive attributes relevant for trial matching while avoiding numerical thresholds and negations.

==== USER PROMPT ====
Create a CONDENSED PATIENT PROFILE (200-300 words) optimized for semantic matching with clinical trial criteria.

Patient Record:
"""
{patient_text}
"""

TASK: Generate a single cohesive paragraph describing this cancer patient's key characteristics for trial matching. This text will be used for embedding-based similarity matching with trial descriptions.

FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON:
1. Cancer diagnoses with specific histology, molecular subtype, and staging
2. Biomarkers and genetic mutations with expression status
3. Key patient characteristics relevant to eligibility (functional status, organ function)
4. Treatment history including lines of therapy and responses
5. Current disease status and treatment needs

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
• INCLUDE ONLY POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES that would qualify for trials
• CONVERT ALL NUMERIC VALUES to descriptive clinical terms:
  * "adult patient" instead of "52-year-old"
  * "high PD-L1 expression" instead of "PD-L1 expression 80%"
  * "adequate renal function" instead of "creatinine 1.1 mg/dL"
  * "good performance status" instead of "ECOG 1"
• USE PRECISE ONCOLOGY TERMINOLOGY consistently
• WRITE AS A SINGLE COHERENT PARAGRAPH without subheadings
• FOCUS ON CURRENT AND FACTUAL patient status
• DO NOT include exclusion criteria or negative characteristics

Your profile should enable optimal semantic similarity matching when compared with trial descriptions formatted in the same style.
