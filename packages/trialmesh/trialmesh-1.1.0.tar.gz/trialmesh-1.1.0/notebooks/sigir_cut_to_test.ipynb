    "## **Notebook Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "The notebook is designed to preprocess and subset the SIGIR2016/TrialGPT clinical trial dataset, focusing on generating a smaller, well-structured development/test set. It ensures that selected samples have non-blank inclusion and exclusion criteria, which is critical for downstream clinical trial eligibility modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Import Management**\n",
    "- Defines a utility (`clean_and_sort_imports`) to deduplicate and sort Python import statements for code hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Data Loading**\n",
    "- Loads three main files from the processed dataset:\n",
    "  - `test.tsv`: Tabular relevance judgments (query-id, corpus-id, score).\n",
    "  - `queries.jsonl`: Patient queries (likely with demographic/clinical info).\n",
    "  - `corpus.jsonl`: Clinical trial records, each with metadata (inclusion/exclusion criteria, drugs, diseases, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Data Inspection**\n",
    "- Displays DataFrame info, basic statistics, and value counts for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "- Inspects the structure/content of queries and corpus data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Subset Construction**\n",
    "- **Small Dev Set Creation:**\n",
    "  - Selects a small number of unique query-ids (e.g., 4 or 6).\n",
    "  - Filters `test.tsv` to these queries.\n",
    "  - For each (query-id, score) pair, keeps the first occurrence.\n",
    "  - Separates positive (score 1/2) and negative (score 0) samples.\n",
    "  - For negatives, retains only those with non-blank inclusion and exclusion criteria in the trial metadata.\n",
    "  - Combines positives and filtered negatives into a new subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full Test Set Option:**\n",
    "  - Alternatively, allows using the entire test set without subsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Corresponding Query/Trial Subsets:**\n",
    "  - Filters `queries.jsonl` and `corpus.jsonl` to only those referenced in the new subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Output**\n",
    "- Writes the filtered `test.tsv`, `queries.jsonl`, and `corpus.jsonl` to a new directory (`processed_cut`), preserving the original format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Data Quality Checks**\n",
    "- Merges positive samples (score 1/2) with trial metadata.\n",
    "- Implements functions to check for missing/blank inclusion or exclusion criteria.\n",
    "- Reports counts of missing fields, supporting data quality assessment for downstream modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical/Architectural Notes**\n",
    "- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that all selected samples have the necessary metadata for eligibility modeling.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Uses pandas for in-memory filtering and merging; processes JSONL line-by-line for memory efficiency.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** Outputs are written in standard formats, facilitating further analysis or model development.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** The code is structured to allow easy adjustment of subset size and filtering criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intended Use**\n",
    "- The resulting subset is suitable for rapid prototyping, debugging, or focused evaluation of clinical trial eligibility models, especially where complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
