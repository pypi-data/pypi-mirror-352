FAST-(OAD)-GA: Future Aircraft Sizing Tool - Overall Aircraft Design (General Aviation extension)
===============================================================================================

FAST-(OAD)-GA is derived from FAST-OAD framework performing rapid Overall Aircraft Design.

It proposes multi-disciplinary analysis and optimisation by relying on
the [OpenMDAO framework](https://openmdao.org/).

FAST-(OAD)-GA allows easy switching between models for a same discipline, and
also adding/removing disciplines to match the need of your study.

Currently, FAST-(OAD)-GA is bundled with models for general aviation and conventional
propulsion (ICE propeller based). Other models will come soon, and you may create
your own models and use them instead of bundled ones.

More details can be found in the [official
documentation](https://fast-ga.readthedocs.io/).

Want to try quickly ?
-------

You can run FAST-OAD-GA notebooks number 1, 2 and 3 using our [Binder-hosted Jupyter notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/supaero-aircraft-design/FAST-GA/HEAD). Just go to src/fastga/notebooks/tutorial after you click the link.

As these Binder-hosted notebooks are not setup to work in a Windows environment, external applications such as OpenVSP and Xfoil can't be run. Therefore, notebook number 4 will not fully work.

Install
-------

**Prerequisite**:FAST-(OAD)-GA needs at least **Python 3.8.0**.

It is recommended (but not required) to install FAST-(OAD)-GA in a virtual
environment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...).

Once Python is installed, FAST-(OAD)-GA can be installed using pip, by doing the following:

``` {.bash}
$ pip install fast-oad-cs23
```
