`pyhough` is a Python package implementing the (Generalized) Frequency-Hough transform for searching **(transient) continuous gravitational waves** from:

- Asymmetrically rotating neutron stars
- Planetary-mass primordial black hole (PBH) binaries
- Newborn neutron stars

This method maps time-frequency tracks from spectrograms (e.g., created by [PyFstat](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat)) into the frequency–spindown parameter space, allowing efficient searches for weak, long-duration gravitational-wave signals.

The frequency-Hough Transform can be applied to either the spectrogram directly after thresholding (and selecting local maxima) to create the peakmap

The Generalized frequency-Hough transform is implemented, but no Python codes exist yet to inject and recover PBH inspirals or signals from newborn neutron stars. Help is welcome on these fronts.

---

## Features

- Construct time–frequency peakmaps from preprocessed data
- Doppler correction for sources in the sky
- Standard Frequency-Hough transform for persistent CW signals
- Generalized Frequency-Hough transform for transient or chirping signals

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyhough
```

---
## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, especially in the following areas:

- Signal injection and recovery tools for PBH binaries and newborn neutron stars

- Unit tests and test coverage

- Improving documentation and usage examples

- Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests!

and also cite the papers that are the basis behind the codes:

The frequency-Hough has been developed by the Rome Virgo group for all-sky searches for continuous waves from non-axisymmetric, rotating neutron stars and can be cited as:

The Generalized Frequency-Hough transform has been developed by the Rome Virgo group for transient continuous-wave searches for newborn neutron stars and can be cited as:

```

    volume = "98",
    number = "10",

```

It has been further generalized to search for gravitational waves from inspiraling planetary-mass primordial black hole binaries:
