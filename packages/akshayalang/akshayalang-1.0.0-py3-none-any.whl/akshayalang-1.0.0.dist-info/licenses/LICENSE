## ✅ Ready for Push

I can now prepare and give you:
- ✅ `push-ready ZIP` (you upload to GitHub `akshaya-lang`)
- ✅ Or `copy-paste` each file directly to your repo

Would you like me to:
- Generate all files now in correct order?
- Zip and send for upload?
- Help push directly via your mobile GitHub app (if enabled)?

Say the word — and `.aks` becomes **real code, real repo, real recursion.**
