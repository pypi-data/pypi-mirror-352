## The [Firebird Butler](https://firebird-butler.rtfd.io/) platform for Python

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/saturnin.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/saturnin)

Saturnin is an implementation of Firebird Butler platform for Python.

> **Note**
For best experience with Saturnin console and other tools, we recommend to use terminal with good support for ANSI escape sequences. On Windows platform, we recommend to use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## License

`saturnin` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.

## Installation

For regular deployments, we recommend installing using the [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
tool, which installs into a separate virtual Python environment and exposes all executable
commands in the search path.

```console
pip install pipx
pipx install saturnin
```
If you want to develop your own services using the Saturnin SDK, we recommend that you
first create a separate virtual environment into which you install Saturnin in the usual
way. For example:

```console
pip install saturnin
```

## Initialization

Saturnin uses a number of files and directories whose location in the file system corresponds
to the standards for the platform on which it is installed. This basic directory placement
scheme can be changed by using the `SATURNIN_HOME` environment variable, which sets the root
of the other directory locations. Alternatively, you can create a `"home"` subdirectory in
the root directory of the virtual environment in which Saturnin is isolated.

> **Warning**
Because on Linux or MacOS the default location of some directories may require higher than
normal access rights, we recommend that you always use the home directory setting on these
platforms.

> **Note**
To set the home directory in the virtual environment (recommended when installing with pipx),
use the command:

   ```console
   saturnin create home
   ```

The next step is to initialize the Saturnin installation with the command:

   ```console
   saturnin initialize
   ```

## Saturnin console

The `saturnin` tool is used to manage the Saturnin platform installation. It can be operated
in two modes:

- **Single command (direct) mode.** The required command and parameters are entered directly on
  the command line, and after the command is executed, the tool is terminated.

- **Interactive console mode** activated by running the tool without additional parameters.
  The interactive console offers an enhanced command line with persistent command history,
  command and parameter completion, and interactive help.

> **Note**
The command set available in console mode differs from command set available in direct mode,
as some commands (typically those required to run only once or not very often like `initialize`
or `create home`) are available only in direct mode.

For normal work, we recommend using the interactive console mode. In the following sections,
all the commands described are entered in the interactive console.

## Installing services


Immediately after installation, Saturnin does not provide any Butler services. These
services need to be installed separately. Although you can install service packages with
the standard pip utility, we recommend that you use saturnin's `install package`,
`uninstall package`, and `pip` commands to install, uninstall, or manage service packages,
as these commands also update the necessary registries that Saturnin uses to work with
Butler services and Saturnin applications.

> **Note**
If necessary, the command: `update registry` can be used to update the registries.

To install package with Saturnin core services, use command:

   ```console
   install package saturnin-core
   ```

## Using Firebird services


To use Butler services that work with Firebird server, you need to create (and update)
a configuration file for the firebird driver using the commands:

   ```console
   create config firebird
   edit config firebird
   ```

## Saturnin recipes

Recipes are Saturnin-specific configuration files with instructions for running Butler
services built for Saturnin. Recipes can be created with the `create recipe` command, which
creates a recipe template that typically needs to be modified further (because it only
contains default values). Recipes created independently (e.g. by a solution supplier or
provided by installed Saturnin application) must be installed with the `install recipe` command.

Created or installed recipes can be run with the `run recipe-name` command. You can get
a list of recipes that can be started with the `list recipes` command.

For more information, see the [Usage Guide](https://saturnin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage-guide.html).
