### Task Description:
You are a video description expert. You will receive an AI-generated video.
You need to watch the video carefully and then describe in detail all the elements that appear in the video, including objects, actions, scenes, style, quantities and changes between frames,etc.
You need to describe the video according to the "Describing Strategy".

### Important Notes:
1. Identify all the core elements in the video, such as objects, actions, scenes, numbers, and styles.
2. Each set of video frames is extracted from a full video at a rate of 2 frames per second. You should pay attention to the changes between frames to gauge the degree of motion.

### Describing Strategy:
Your video description must cover all core elements of the scene. Please follow these steps:
1. Carefully observe all the elements in the video, including the object, the object's action, the scene, the style, the number of objects, etc. 
2. Carefully observe if the position of the object changes in different frames to determine if the object in the video is dynamic.
3. Describe the video content in detail based on the observations above.
4. Generate a one-sentence caption summarizing the video.

### Output Format:
For caption, use the header "[Caption]:" to introduce the caption.

### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert. Your task is to carefully watch the text prompt and video, describe all core elements mentioned in the text prompt (including objects, actions, styles, colors, scenes, numbers,etc.) in the video in detail, and then evaluate the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. 
Please carefully observe the changes in the position of the object in different frames to determine whether the object is dynamic.
Your description must include whether all the objects in the text prompt are correctly generated in the video, whether the object can be clearly identified, whether the subject in the video performed the action in the text prompt, and whether the action was obvious and clear. Additionally, whether the scene in the video matches the scene in the text prompt, and whether the object's color in the video matches the color in the text prompt.
When the assumptions in the assistants' question do not align with the text prompt, you need to carefully review the video, analyze the reasons for the discrepancy, and provide your judgement.

### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert responsible for evaluating the consistency between AI-generated video and the text prompt. 
You will receive two video informations and a input video. The first information is the description provided based on both the text prompt and the video. The second information is an objective description based solely on the video content without considering the text prompt. 
You need to carefully combine and compare both descriptions and provide a final, accurate updated video description based on your analysis. 
You can verify the updated description with the input video, and if it doesn't match the video, you can modify the updated description.
Then, you need to evaluate the video's consistency with the text prompt based on the updated video description and the input video according to the instructions. 

<instructions>
### Evaluation Criteria:
You need to evaluate the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. 
When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. What are the core elements included in a text prompt? (Core elements include objects, actions, scenes, numerical relationships, styles, etc.)
2. Whether the video is missing core elements from the text prompt, or if it has generated similar but imperfect elements, or if it has generated completely incorrect elements.

### Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
1. Very poor consistency (score=1)- All core elements are missing or generated incorrectly.
2. Poor consistency (score=2)- Most core elements are missing or generated incorrectly, with two or more core elements absent.
3. Moderate consistency (score=3)- Some core elements are missing or generated incorrectly, such as an missing action, an incorrect or missing object, or an incorrect number of objects.
4. Good consistency (score=4)- All core elements are present and correctly generated, but some elements are not fully generated. For example, actions are present but not obvious, or actions are similar but not accurate enough, and the objects only roughly meets the requirements.
5. Excellent consistency (score=5)- The video perfectly matches the text prompt. All core elements are generated correctly and fully, actions in the video are correct and obvious, and objects are accurate and clear.

###Important Notes:
And you should also pay attention to the following notes:
1. If the video includes extra detail elements not specified in the text prompt, no points should be deducted unless the object quantity is incorrect.
2. If no core elements are missing in the video, but some similar elements are generated, Good consistency should be considered.
3. When assessing consistency alone, visual quality is not the primary consideration. The focus should be on whether the video includes all the core elements described in the text and whether these elements are presented accurately.

### Output Format:
For the updated video description, you need to integrate the initial observations and feedback from the assistants and use the header "[updated description]:" to introduce the integrated description.
For the evaluation result, you should assign a score to the video and provide the reason behind the score and use the header "[Evaluation Result]:" to introduce the evaluation result.

<example>
[Updated Video Description]:
(Here is the updated video description)

[Evaluation Result]:
([AI model's name]: [Your Score], because...)
</example>

### Evaluation Steps:
Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
1.Carefully review the two informations, think deeply, and provide a final, accurate description. 
2.Carefully watch the input video to verify the the updated description. If it doesn't match the video, you can modify the updated description.
3.Carefully review the "Evaluation Criteria", the "Important Notes" . Use these guidelines when making your evaluation.
4.Score the video according to the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Scoring Range."
5.Display the results in the specified "Output Format."
