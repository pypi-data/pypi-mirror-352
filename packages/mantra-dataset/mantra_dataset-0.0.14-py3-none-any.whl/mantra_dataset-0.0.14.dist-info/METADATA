MANTRA is a dataset consisting of *combinatorial triangulations* of
manifolds. It can be used to create novel algorithms in topological
deep learning or debug existing ones. See our [ICLR 2025
paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=X6y5CC44HM) for more details and
our [benchmarks repository](https://github.com/aidos-lab/mantra-benchmarks) for
additional code to reproduce all experiments.

## Getting the Dataset

The raw MANTRA dataset consisting of $2$- and $3$-manifolds with up to $10$ vertices 
is provided [here](https://github.com/aidos-lab/mantra/releases/latest). 
For machine-learning applications and research, we provide a custom
dataset loader package, which can be installed via the following command:

```console
pip install mantra-dataset
```

After installation, the dataset can be used like this:

```python
from mantra.datasets import ManifoldTriangulations

dataset = ManifoldTriangulations(
    root="./data",      # Root folder for storing data
    manifold="2",       # Whether to load 2- or 3-manifolds
    version="latest"    # Which version of the dataset to load
)
```

Provided you have [`pytorch-geometric`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) installed,
here is a more comprehensive example, showing the use of *random node features* and how to transform it
for using graph neural networks:

```python
from torch_geometric.transforms import Compose
from torch_geometric.transforms import FaceToEdge

from mantra.datasets import ManifoldTriangulations
from mantra.transforms import NodeIndex
from mantra.transforms impor RandomNodeFeatures


dataset = ManifoldTriangulations(
    root="./data",
    manifold="2",
    version="latest",
    transform=Compose(
        [
            NodeIndex(),
            RandomNodeFeatures(),
            # Converts face indices to edge indices, thus essentially
            # making the 1-skeleton available to a model.
            FaceToEdge(remove_faces=False),
        ]
    ),
    force_reload=True,
)
```

## FAQ

#### Q: Why MANTRA?
A: MANTRA is one of the first datasets providing prediction tasks that provably depend on the high-order features of the input data, in the case of MANTRA, simplices. MANTRA contributes to the benchmarking ecosystem for high-order neural networks by providing a large set of triangulations with precomputed topological properties that can be easily computed with deterministic algorithms but that are hard to compute for predictive models. The topological properties contained in MANTRA are elementary, meaning that good networks tackling complex topological problems should be able to completely solve this dataset. Currently, there is no model that can solve all the prediction tasks proposed in the dataset's paper. 

#### Q: Why topological features?
A: Topology forms a fundamental theoretical foundation for natural sciences like physics and biology. Understanding a system's topology often reveals critical insights hardly accessible through other analytical methods. For neural networks to effectively tackle problems in these domains, they must develop capabilities to leverage topological information. This requires network architectures capable of identifying basic topological invariants in data—precisely the invariants that MANTRA provides. By incorporating these topological features, neural networks can capture essential structural and relational properties that traditional approaches might miss, enhancing their ability to model complex natural phenomena.


#### Q: Which are the main functions and classes implemented in this dataset?
A: The core class of the MANTRA package is `ManifoldTriangulations`. `ManifoldTriangulations` allows the user to load the MANTRA dataset using a `InMemoryDataset` format from [`torch_geometric`]([`torch_geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). The transforms `NodeIndex`, `RandomNodeFeatures`, `DegreeTransform`, and `DegreeTransformOneHot`are also provided in this package. Concretely, `NodeIndex` transforms the original triangulation format in a torch-like tensor, and `RandomNodeFeatures`, `DegreeTransform`, and `DegreeTransformOneHot` assign input feature vectors to vertices in a the `x` attribute of the input `Data` representing a triangulation based either on random features or on the degree of each vertex, respectively.
