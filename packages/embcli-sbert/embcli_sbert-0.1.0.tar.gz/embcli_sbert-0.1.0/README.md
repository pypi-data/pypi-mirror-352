# list all available models.
emb models
SentenceTransformerModel
    Vendor: sbert
    Models:
    * sentence-transformers (aliases: sbert)
    Default Local Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    See https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html for available local models.
    Model Options:

# get an embedding for an input text by an original sentence-transformers model, the default is all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
# it'll take a while to download the model from Hugging Face Hub for the first time.
emb embed -m sbert "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input text by another model, all-mpnet-base-v2.
emb embed -m sbert/all-mpnet-base-v2 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input by a community model.
emb embed -m sbert/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# calculate similarity score between two texts by all-MiniLM-L6-v2. the default metric is cosine similarity.

### Document Indexing and Search

You can use the `emb` command to index documents and perform semantic search. `emb` uses [`chroma`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) for the default vector database.

```bash
# index example documents in the current directory.
emb ingest-sample -m sbert -c catcafe --corpus cat-names-en

# or, you can give the path to your documents.
# the documents should be in a CSV file with two columns: id and text. the separator should be comma.
emb ingest -m sbert -c catcafe -f <path-to-your-documents>

# search for a query in the indexed documents.
emb search -m sbert -c catcafe -q "Who's the naughtiest one?"
