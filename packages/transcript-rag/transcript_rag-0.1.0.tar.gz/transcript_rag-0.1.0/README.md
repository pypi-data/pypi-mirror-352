# OSCE RAG Experiments

This repository contains notebooks exploring retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for Objective Structured Clinical Examination videos. The original notebooks are provided in the `OSCE-RAG-main.zip` archive.

A lightweight Python package `transcript-rag` is included for embedding transcript files into ChromaDB and querying them via a command line tool. See `transcript_rag/README.md` for details.
