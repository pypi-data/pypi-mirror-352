# This table defines the operator set to identify operations in the
# computational graph of a given model. It is based on ATen operator set,
# so that each entry corresponds to the basic building block in the
# computational graph while ensuring compatibility with PyTorch.
#
# The latest version of ATen operator set can be found at
# https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/aten/src/ATen/native/native_functions.yaml
# or by running `python3 -c "import torch; print(dir(torch.ops.aten))"`.
#
# Note that this operator set is under development and more operators
# will be added in the future.
