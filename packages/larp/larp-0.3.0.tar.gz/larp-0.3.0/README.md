# Larp: Last-Mile Restrictive Planning

A fast, flexible Python toolkit for path planning using artificial potential fields and multi-scale cell decomposition—optimized for dynamic environments and complex spatial constraints.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Larp** (/lärp/) introduces a novel approach to path planning by leveraging restrictive potential fields as continuous cost maps and decomposing them into a hierarchy of cells. Each cell is assigned a restriction zone based on proximity to obstacles. Larp supports multi-resolution navigation, hot reloading of obstacles, custom path planning policies, and advanced routing optimization.

Originally developed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban air mobility scenarios, Larp's versatile architecture makes it applicable to a broad range of safe and efficient navigation problems.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Restrictive Potential Fields**: Models obstacles and constraints using repulsive potential fields.
- **Multi-Scale Cell Decomposition**: Enables efficient navigation and spatial querying via hierarchical cell partitioning.
- **Multi-Faceted Path Planning**: Combines artificial potential fields with cell-based decomposition for route generation.
- **Customizable Trajectory Planning**: Custom.
- **Flexible Application Domains**: Applicable to UAVs, autonomous vehicles, mobile robotics, and more.
