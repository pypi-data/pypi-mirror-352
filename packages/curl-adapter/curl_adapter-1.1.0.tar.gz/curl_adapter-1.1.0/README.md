# Curl Adapter
[![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/curl-adapter/month)](https://pypi.org/project/curl-adapter/)

A module that plugs directly into the Python *[requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)* library and replaces the default *urllib3* HTTP adapter with **cURL**,  equipped with TLS fingerprint-changing capabilities.

## Why?

Specifically, this module is meant to be used with the "curl impersonate" python bindings ([lexiforest/curl_cffi](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi)), in order to send HTTP requests with custom, browser-like TLS & HTTP/2 fingerprints for bypassing sites that detect and block normal python requests (such as [Cloudflare](https://www.nstbrowser.io/en/blog/how-does-cloudflare-detect-bots) for example).

  <summary>Note</summary>
Even though <i><a href="https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi">curl_cffi</a></i> already has an API that *mimicks* the <i>requests</i>  library, it comes with some compatibility issues (e.g. response.raw not available, response.history, differences in headers, cookies, json, etc.).
<br><br>
    With curl-adapter, instead of copying and mimicking the <i>requests</i> library API, the low level HTTP adapter is changed with a custom crafted one, and everything else is exactly the same (even the exceptions are mapped). 
<br><br>
With a single switch you can enable/disable curl for your requests, without needing to worry about changing the way you normally work with requests.
<br><br>
Though, if you're looking for async support or websockets, you should definitely checkout the <i>curl_cffi</i> instead, since by default, the requests library is only sync.

You can also use curl-adapter with [pycurl](https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl). 

Additionally, this module is optimized for seamless integration with [Gevent](https://github.com/gevent/gevent).


## Installation
```console
pip install curl-adapter --upgrade --ignore-installed
```

## Usage
Basic example:
```python
import requests
from curl_adapter import CurlCffiAdapter

session = requests.Session()
session.mount("http://", CurlCffiAdapter())
session.mount("https://", CurlCffiAdapter())

# just use requests session like you normally would
session.get("https://example.com")
```

Configuring curl impersonate options:

```python
import requests
from curl_adapter import CurlCffiAdapter

curl_cffi_adapter = CurlCffiAdapter(
    # This is the default
    impersonate_browser_type="chrome", 

    # Optionally set additional options
    tls_configuration_options={
        "ja3_str": "...",
        "akamai_str": "...",
        "extra_fp": ExtraFingerprints(...),
    }
)

# you can use 'with ...' for just making a single request
with requests.Session() as s:
    s.mount("http://", curl_cffi_adapter)
    s.mount("https://", curl_cffi_adapter)

    s.get("https://example.com")
```

Using it with [pycurl](https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl):

```python
import requests
from curl_adapter import PyCurlAdapter

with requests.Session() as s:
    s.mount("http://", PyCurlAdapter())
    s.mount("https://", PyCurlAdapter())

    s.get("https://example.com")
```

## More
You can get extra information from the curl response info:
```python
import requests
from curl_adapter import PyCurlAdapter, CurlInfo

with requests.Session() as s:
    s.mount("http://", PyCurlAdapter())
    s.mount("https://", PyCurlAdapter())

    response = s.get("https://example.com")

    body = response.text

    curl_info: CurlInfo = response.curl_info

    print(
        curl_info
    )
```

Returns a simple dict:
```python
{
    'local_ip':'192.168.1.1',
    'local_port':19219,
    'primary_ip':'142.250.200.142',
    'primary_port':443,
    'request_size':0,
    'request_body_size':0,
    'response_header_size':418,
    'ssl_verify_result':0,
    'proxy_ssl_verify_result':0,
    'starttransfer_time':171335,
    'connect_time':33231,
    'appconnect_time':47274,
    'pretransfer_time':47378,
    'namelookup_time':1025,
    'has_used_proxy':0,
    'speed_download':52081115, # only available after the body has been read
    'speed_upload':0, # only available after the body has been read
    'response_body_size':519958376, # only available after the body has been read
    'total_time':9983626, # only available after the body has been read
}
```
Note that some cURL information fields are only availabe after the body stream has been fully consumed, so keep that in mind when using `stream=True` option.
