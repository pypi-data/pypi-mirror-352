# CTFBridge

**CTFBridge** is your all-in-one Python toolkit for automating Capture The Flag (CTF) workflows — whether you're farming flags, building bots, or writing automation tools.

Forget juggling inconsistent APIs or hacking together one-off scripts. CTFBridge gives you **one clean interface** for multiple CTF platforms — so you can focus on solving challenges.

- 🔐 Manage sessions (login, API tokens, persistence)
- 🤖 Build bots, auto-solvers, or monitoring tools with async-first design

## ✨ Why CTFBridge?

- ✅ **One API for all major platforms** — CTFd, rCTF, HTB, and more
- 🧠 **Smart auto-detection** — just give a URL, and we handle the rest
- 🧩 **Challenge enrichment** — attachments, services and more built in
- 🔄 **Persistent sessions** — save & resume your session state
