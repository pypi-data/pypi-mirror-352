aiokatcp is an implementation of the `katcp`_ protocol based around the Python
asyncio system module. It requires Python 3.8 or later. It is loosely inspired
by the `Python 2 bindings`_, but has a much narrower scope.

The current implementation provides both client and server APIs. It only
supports katcp version 5, and does not support a number of features that are
marked deprecated in version 5.
