        <title>API Response Data Validation</title>
        <description>
            Always validate and sanitize API response models before returning data to clients.
            Implement comprehensive checks to prevent exposure of sensitive data including credit
            card numbers, CVV codes, internal system identifiers, database keys, and other
            confidential information. Create explicit data transfer objects (DTOs) that only include
            necessary fields and exclude all PCI-regulated data elements.
