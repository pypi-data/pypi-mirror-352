    "fire_summary": "Critical feature to prevent unintended duplicate charges. Without idempotency support, the system currently processes identical transaction requests multiple times, potentially charging customers repeatedly for the same purchase. This presents significant financial risk to customers, reputational damage to merchants, and potential regulatory compliance issues.Implementation requires adding idempotency keys to transaction requests and modifying the processing logic to detect repeated submissions. Security concerns include protection against key guessing attacks, race conditions, and potential denial of service through key exhaustion.This feature is essential for production-readiness of the transaction processing API.",
