# Security Prime MCP

The Security Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is an open-source tool that combines AI assistance with security expertise
 to streamline how developers build secure applications. 
 It provides contextual guidance specific to security best practices,
  helping developers make informed decisions about security implementation, vulnerability assessment, and compliance throughout the entire application development lifecycle.
  With Security MCP, developers can build reliable, secure, and production-ready applications with confidence.

## Features
1. Security Analysis and Assessment
- Analyze code, systems, and processes for potential security vulnerabilities
- Identify security risks and threat vectors in software applications
- Provide detailed security assessments for development projects
- Evaluate compliance with security standards and frameworks (OWASP, NIST, etc.)

2. Security Recommendations and Implementation
- Provide actionable security recommendations based on identified issues
- Suggest specific remediation steps for security vulnerabilities
- Recommend security controls and countermeasures
- Prioritize security issues based on risk level and impact

3. Secure Coding Guidelines
- Provide secure coding practices and standards
- Offer language-specific security guidelines
- Recommend secure libraries and frameworks
- Guide implementation of security patterns and anti-patterns

4. Security Issue Management
- Summarize security-related tickets and issues
- Provide clear, concise explanations of security problems
- Translate technical security concepts for different audiences
- Create executive summaries of security findings

## Usage Notes
- The server provides three main tools: `issue_summary()`, `recommendations()`, and `code_guideline()`
- Each tool is designed for specific security-related tasks and should be used according to the use cases
- Security recommendations are prioritized based on risk level and impact
- All guidance follows current industry standards and best practices

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of software security concepts
2. Familiarity with security standards (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
3. Knowledge of the target application's technology stack
4. Access to relevant security documentation and resources

## Security Focus Areas
- Authentication and Authorization
- Data Protection
- Input Validation
- Network Security
- Infrastructure Security
- Application Security
- Compliance

## Best Practices
1. Always use the most appropriate tool for the specific security need
2. Combine tools when necessary for comprehensive security guidance
3. Prioritize security recommendations based on risk and impact
4. Provide context for security measures
5. Include implementation examples in coding guidelines
6. Reference current security standards and best practices

## Error Handling and Limitations

- If unable to load security data, inform the client and suggest alternative approaches
- Acknowledge when security recommendations may need customization for specific environments
- Clearly state when additional security assessment may be required
- Recommend consulting with security professionals for complex scenarios


Remember: Your primary goal is to help organizations and developers build more secure systems by providing expert security guidance, practical recommendations, and actionable implementation steps.
