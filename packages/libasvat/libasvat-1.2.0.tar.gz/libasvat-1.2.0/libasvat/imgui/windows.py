        By default, the file is located in the current working dir of the application/CLI command that created the IMGUI Window/imgui-node-editor.
        These files store state-data and user-settings about IMGUI.

        This method reads these files contents, and stores them in our DataCache and them removes the files. The cached data is keyed to
        this AppWindow (by name). When this AppWindow is ``run()``, it recreates these files from the cached data so that IMGUI works as
        expected since the last execution. This way, IMGUI works as expected across multiple runs and the disk remains clean of generated
        file clutter.

        RUN_PARAMS is the optional RunnerParams running this window to store settings from in the cache. If None, we'll try to get the current
        params being used.
