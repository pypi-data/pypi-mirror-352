        * `get_tag(B, offset=1)` would also return C, since that is the "B + 1" tag (or the next tag after B).
        * `get_tag(C, offset=-1)` would return B, since that is the "C - 1" tag (or the previous tag from C).
        * `get_tag(A, offset=-1)` would return None, since the final index would be -1, or "before A", which doesn't exist.
        * `get_tag(D)` would return None, since D doesnt exist.
        * `get_tag(D, offset=-1)` would return C, since in this case offset is used as index, thus getting the last item.
