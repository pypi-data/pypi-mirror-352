# pyROT: Python RayOcular Tools

Python RayOcular Tools is a Python library to complement RayOcular, an eye-specific module of RaySearch.
It currently consists of three parts:

1. `pyROT` itself, which is Python package provides a set of tools to work with eye models in Python. This library is designed to be as vendor-agnostic as possible, allowing it to be used without RaySearch. Interactions with RaySearch are handled through `pyrot.ro_interface`;
2. `scripts` contains a set of scripts that can be run from within RaySearch and perform common tasks, such as generating eye models. These scripts import the `pyROT` package for all calculations.
3. `standalone`, as set of Python scripts that can be used without RaySearch, for example to analyse a large set of eye models (still to be added).

In addition, we hope that the pyROT repository will provide a platform to exchange methods and scripts within the ocular Proton Therapy community.

## Installation

to be added

## Future ideas

- Extend the `pyROT` package with more tools, such as to determine the optimal gazing angle for a given eye model.
- Extend the unit tests to cover more of the `pyROT` package.
