    A python package that does the <code>LEGWORK</code> for you by evolving binaries,
    computing signal-to-noise ratios for binary systems potentially observable with LISA
    and visualising the results.

### Installation
Put simply? `pip install legwork`! But we recommend creating a conda environment first to ensure everything goes smoothly! Check out the installation instructions [here](https://legwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to learn exactly how to install LEGWORK

LEGWORK has a couple of dependencies: `numpy`, `astropy`, `numba`, `scipy`, `schwimmbad`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the exact version requirements). These will be installed automatically if you follow the installation instructions!
