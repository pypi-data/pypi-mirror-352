## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites ✅

- Python 3.9 or higher (as specified in `pyproject.toml`)
- A Shovels API key

### Installation ⬇️

**For users:**

- **Install using poetry (recommended) or pip:**
  ```bash
  poetry add pyshovels
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  pip install pyshovels
  ```

**For contributors:**

- **Fork and clone the repo and install in editable mode:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pyshovels.git
  cd pyshovels
  ```
  then
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

**Setting your API key:**

- **Set your Shovels API key as an environment variable:**
  - Add your Shovels API key to a `.env` file - look at the [.env.example](.env.example) file for an example
  - Or set it as an environment variable directly
    ```bash
    export SHOVELS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```
  - Then, load the environment variables using the `load_env` function:
    ```python
    from pyshovels import load_env, ShovelsAPI
    load_env(env_path="./path/to/.env")
    shovels = ShovelsAPI()
    ```
- **Or pass the API key as an argument to the `ShovelsAPI` class:**
  ```python
  from pyshovels import ShovelsAPI
  shovels = ShovelsAPI(api_key="your-api-key")
  ```
  > ⚠️ **Note:**
  > If passing the API key as an argument, be careful not to accidentally share it with others.

## Usage 📚
