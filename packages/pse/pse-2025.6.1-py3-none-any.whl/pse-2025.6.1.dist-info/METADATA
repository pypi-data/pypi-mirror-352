                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## The Problem: Unreliable LLM Outputs

Raw LLM outputs are structurally unpredictable, breaking systems that require specific formats (API calls, tool use, structured data). Prompting for structure is inconsistent; post-processing is inefficient and often fails on complex or nested formats.

## The Solution: Runtime Structural Enforcement

The **Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)** provides **guaranteed structural validity** by enforcing constraints *during* LLM generation.

Define your required output structure using Pydantic, JSON Schema, function signatures, or PSE's composable types. PSE compiles this into a high-performance Hierarchical State Machine (HSM). Integrated into the generation loop, the HSM engine guides the LLM, ensuring every generated token conforms to the defined structure.

**Result: Structurally perfect output, generated correctly the first time.**

## Core Capabilities

*   **100% Structural Guarantee:** Eliminate schema violations, parsing errors, and malformed outputs. Enables reliable downstream processing and state management.
*   **Handles Complexity & Recursion:** Reliably generate deeply nested JSON, valid code, or custom recursive formats via the core HSM engine.
*   **Flexible Schema Definition:** Configure instantly using **Pydantic models**, **JSON Schema**, **Python function signatures**, or compose custom structures with `pse.types`.
*   **Robust & Resilient:** Built-in **Token Healing** recovers from minor tokenization artifacts. Principled path selection resolves ambiguity deterministically.
*   **High-Performance C++ Core:** Optimized HSM engine delivers guaranteed structure with minimal latency (~20ms/token overhead). ([Benchmarks](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/llm-structured-output-benchmarks))
*   **Model & Framework Agnostic:** Integrates with any local LLM stack via standard logits processing (`process_logits`) and sampling (`sample`) hooks. Optional mixins simplify `transformers` integration (PyTorch, TF, JAX).
*   **Advanced Grammar Composition:** Use `pse.types` (`Chain`, `Loop`, `Any`, etc.) to build custom HSMs for bespoke structural requirements beyond standard schemas.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pse
```
or
```bash
uv add pse
```
*(Installs the `pse` Python library and its required `pse-core` dependency. See [Installation Docs](https://docs.theproxycompany.com/pse/getting-started/installation/) for framework extras and setup)*

## Quickstart: Pydantic to Guaranteed JSON

This example demonstrates generating JSON output matching a Pydantic schema using `transformers`.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pse import StructuringEngine
from pse.util.torch_mixin import PSETorchMixin # Optional: Mixin for easy HF integration

# 1. Define structure
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    username: str
    is_active: bool
    roles: list[str]

# 2. (Optional) Apply PSE mixin to model class
class PSE_Llama(PSETorchMixin, LlamaForCausalLM): pass

# 3. Load model & tokenizer
model_path = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct" # Example
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = PSE_Llama.from_pretrained( # Or your base model class
    model_path, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto"
)
if tokenizer.pad_token is None: tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id

# 4. Init & Configure Engine (Mixin attaches as model.engine)
model.engine = StructuringEngine(tokenizer)
model.engine.configure(UserProfile) # Compile structure to HSM

# 5. Create prompt & input IDs
prompt = f"Generate a user profile: ID 999, username 'tester', active true, roles ['qa', 'dev']. Output ONLY the JSON."
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, return_tensors="pt", add_generation_prompt=True
).to(model.device)

# 6. Generate (PSE hooks applied via mixin or manually)
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids, max_new_tokens=150, do_sample=True,
    # Manual hook example (if not using mixin):
    # logits_processor=[model.engine.process_logits], sampler=model.engine.sample
)

# 7. Decode & Parse (Guaranteed by PSE)
output_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0][input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
structured_output: UserProfile | None = model.engine.get_structured_output(UserProfile)

print("Raw Output (Guided by PSE):\n", output_text)
print("\nParsed Pydantic Object:\n", structured_output)
# Expected: UserProfile(user_id=999, username='tester', is_active=True, roles=['qa', 'dev'])
```

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for more use cases, including JSON Schema and custom `StateMachine` composition.

## Why PSE?

PSE's **runtime HSM enforcement** offers fundamental advantages over other methods:

| Capability                | PSE (Runtime HSM)     | Prompting / Retries   | Regex / Post-Proc.  | Simple Masking      |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ |
| **Guaranteed Structure**  | **100%**              | Probabilistic         | Fixes Errors        | Flat Only           |
| **Complex/Nested**        | **Handles Natively**  | Brittle / Fails       | Impractical         | Cannot Handle       |
| **Recursion**             | **Handles Natively**  | No                    | No                  | No                  |
| **Reliability**           | **Production Grade**  | Low                   | Error-prone         | Brittle             |
| **Efficiency**            | **Optimized C++**     | Retries Cost          | Slow                | Fast (Simple)       |
| **Token Healing**         | **Built-in**          | N/A                   | N/A                 | Breaks              |

## Integration

Integrate PSE into your generation loop via two hooks:
1.  `logits_processor=[engine.process_logits]`
2.  `sampler=engine.sample` (wraps your base sampler)

Works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, MLX, etc. Optional `transformers` mixins simplify integration. *(See [Docs](https://docs.theproxycompany.com/pse/) for details)*

## Foundation for Reliable Agents

PSE provides the structural guarantees required for reliable agentic systems, powering the **[Proxy Base Agent (PBA)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-base-agent)** for dependable state transitions and tool use.

## License & Source Availability
