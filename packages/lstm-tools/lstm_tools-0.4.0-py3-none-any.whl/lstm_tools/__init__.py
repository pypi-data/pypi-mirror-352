"""LSTM Tools - A library for handling sequential data efficiently.

LSTM Tools provides custom numpy array subclasses designed for time series data,
with a focus on easy windowing, feature compression, and machine learning integration.

Main Classes:
- Feature: A float subclass representing an individual data point
- FeatureSample: A 1D array of Feature objects for a single time series
- TimeFrame: A 1D array of Feature objects for a point in time
- Sample: A 2D array of TimeFrame objects for a sequence of observations
- Chronicle: A 3D array of windowed samples for ML model training
